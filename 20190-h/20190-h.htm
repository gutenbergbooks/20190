<big>[Transcriber's Notes]<br>
<br>
This is one of the first books I remember reading as a child. Some of <br>
the items are thoughtfully written, like how to write checks. Many <br>
others are just rumors or careless opinions. Some are "racy" ads. Many <br>
articles are lead-ins to the advertisements. Whatever their truth, they
<br>
are interesting reading, calculated to draw the attention of drug store
<br>
customers of 1910.<br>
<br>
The text of the advertisements have been reproduced along with the<br>
accompanying graphics. Correct grammar and punctuation has been
sacrificed<br>
to preserving the original format of the ads.<br>
<br>
<big>"</big>Mother's Remedies, Over One Thousand Tried and Tested
Remedies from Mothers<br>
of the United States and Canada" (Gutenberg EText 17439) is a book for a<br>

Manners and Customs of Good Society<br>
<br>
ETIQUETTE OF COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.<br>
<br>
It is a growing custom in America not to announce an engagement until<br>
the date of the marriage is approximately settled. Long engagements are<br>
irksome to both man and woman, and a man is generally not supposed to<br>
ask a girl to marry him until he is able to provide a home for her.<br>
This, however, does not prevent long friendships between young couples<br>
or a sentimental understanding growing up between them, and it is during<br>
this period that they learn to know each other and find out if they are<br>
suited for a life's partnership.<br>
<br>
When a "young man goes a-courting" it generally means that he has some<br>
particular girl in mind whom he has singled out as the object of his<br>
devotion. A man a-courting is generally on his best behavior, and many a<br>
happily married wife looks back on her courting days as the most<br>
delightful of her life. At that time the woman is the object of a<br>
devotion to which she has as yet conceded nothing. She is still at<br>
liberty to weigh and choose, to compare her lover to other men, while<br>
the knowledge that she is the ultimate girl that some man is trying to<br>
win gives her a pretty sense of self-importance and a feeling that she<br>
has come into the heritage of womanhood.<br>
<br>
Whether it is one of the fictions about courtship or not, it is<br>
generally assumed that a young woman is longer in making up her mind<br>
than is the young man. When a man finds the right girl he is pretty apt<br>
to know it, and it is his business then to start out and persuade her to<br>
his point of view. "Neither willing nor reluctant" is the attitude of<br>
the young girl.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gifts and Attention.<br>
<br>
Just what attention a man is privileged to show a young woman to whom he<br>
is not engaged, and yet to whom he wishes to express his devotion, is a<br>
point a little difficult to define.<br>
<br>
If she is a bookish girl she will be pleased with gifts of books or the<br>
suggestion that they may read the same books so they may talk them over<br>
together. She will probably feel complimented if a man discusses with<br>
her his business affairs and the problems that are interesting men in<br>
their life work. When a man begins to call often and regularly on a girl<br>
it is best to have some topic of conversation aside from personalities.<br>
<br>
When a man is led to spend more money than he can afford in entertaining<br>
a girl it is a bad preparation for matrimony. Courtship is a time when a<br>
man desires to bring gifts, and it is quite right and fitting that he<br>
should do so within reasonable limits. A girl of refined feelings does<br>
not like to accept valuable presents from a man at this period of their<br>
acquaintance. Flowers, books, music, if the girl plays or sings, and<br>
boxes of candy are always permissible offerings which neither engage the<br>
man who offers them nor the girl who receives them. This is the time<br>
when a man invites a girl to the theater, to concerts and lectures, and<br>
may offer to escort her to church. The pleasure of her society is<br>
supposed to be a full return for the trouble and expense incurred in<br>
showing these small attentions.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Claims of Companionship.<br>
<br>
A man cannot justly complain if a girl accepts similar favors from other<br>
men, for until he has proposed and been accepted he has no claim on her<br>
undivided companionship. An attitude of proprietorship on his part,<br>
particularly if it is exercised in public, is as bad manners as it is<br>
unwise, and a high-spirited girl, although she may find her feelings<br>
becoming engaged, is prone to resent it. It should be remembered that a<br>
man is free to cease his attentions, and until he has finally<br>
surrendered his liberty he should not expect her to devote all her time<br>
to him.<br>
<br>
At this period it is a wise man who makes a friend of a girl's mother,<br>
and if he does this he will generally be repaid in a twofold manner. No<br>
matter how willful a girl may be, her mother's opinion of her friends<br>
always has weight with her.<br>
<br>
Moreover, what the mother is the girl will in all probability become,<br>
and a man has no better opportunity of learning a girl's mental and<br>
moral qualities than by knowing the woman who bore and reared her.<br>
<br>
<br>
Engagement and Wedding Rings.<br>
<br>
The form and material of "the mystic ring of marriage" change but<br>
little, and innovations on the plain gold band are rarely successful.<br>
The very broad, flat band is now out of date and replaced by a much<br>
narrower ring, sufficiently thick, however, to stand the usage of a<br>
lifetime. It is generally engraved on the concealed side with the<br>
initials of the giver and the date of the marriage. The gold in the ring<br>
should be as pure as possible, and the color, which depends on the alloy<br>
used, should be unobtrusive, the pale gold being better liked now than<br>
the red gold. Many women never remove their wedding ring after it has<br>
been put on and believe it is bad luck to do so.<br>
<br>
There is but one choice for an engagement ring, a solitaire diamond, and<br>
clusters or colored stones are not considered in this connection. As<br>
after the wedding the engagement ring is used as a guard to the wedding<br>
ring, it should be as handsome as possible, and a small, pure stone is a<br>
far better choice than a more showy one that may be a little off in<br>
color or possess a flaw.<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct Form in Jewelry.<br>
<br>
On the wedding day the groom often makes the bride a wedding present of<br>
some piece of jewelry, and if this is to be worn during the ceremony it<br>
should consist of white stones in a thin gold or platinum setting, such<br>
as a pendant, bracelet or pin of pearls and diamonds. If a colored stone<br>
is preferred--and a turquoise, for instance, adds the touch of blue<br>
which is supposed to bring a bride good luck--it should be concealed<br>
inside the dress during the services.<br>
<br>
As a memento of the event a groom often presents his ushers with a scarf<br>
pin or watch or cigarette case ornamented with the initials of the bride<br>
and groom, and the bride generally makes a similar present to her<br>
bridesmaids of some dainty piece of jewelry. Whether this takes the form<br>
of a pin, bracelet or one of the novelties that up-to-date jewelers are<br>
always showing, it should be the best of its kind. Imitation stones or<br>
"silver gilt" have no place as wedding gifts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wedding Customs.<br>
<br>
There is no time in a woman's life when ceremonies seem so important as<br>
when a wedding in the family is imminent. Whether the wedding is to be a<br>
simple home ceremony or an elaborate church affair followed by a<br>
reception, the formalities which etiquette prescribes for these<br>
functions should be carefully studied and followed. Only by doing so can<br>
there be the proper dignity, and above all the absence of confusion that<br>
should mark the most important episode in the life of a man or woman.<br>
<br>
Wedding customs have undergone some changes of late years, mostly in the<br>
direction of simplicity. Meaningless display and ostentation should be<br>
avoided, and, if a girl is marrying into a family much better endowed in<br>
worldly goods than her own, she should have no false pride in insisting<br>
on simple festivities and in preventing her family from incurring<br>
expense that they cannot afford. The entire expenses of a wedding, with<br>
the exception of the clergyman's fee and the carriage which takes the<br>
bride and groom away for their honeymoon, are met by the bride's family,<br>
and there is no worse impropriety than in allowing the groom to meet or<br>
share any of these obligations. Rather than allow this a girl would show<br>
more self-respect in choosing to do away with the social side of the<br>
function and be content with the marriage ceremony read by her clergyman<br>
under his own roof.<br>
<br>
<br>
Invitations and Announcements.<br>
<br>
In the case of a private wedding announcement cards should be mailed the<br>
following day to all relatives and acquaintances of both the contracting<br>
parties.<br>
<br>
Evening weddings are no longer the custom, and the fashionable hour is<br>
now high noon, although in many cases three o'clock in the afternoon is<br>
the hour chosen. Whether the wedding is to be followed by a reception or<br>
not, the invitations to it should be sent out not less than two weeks<br>
before the event, and these should be promptly accepted or declined by<br>
those receiving them. The acceptance of a wedding invitation by no means<br>
implies that the recipient is obliged to give a present. These are only<br>
expected of relatives and near friends of the bride and groom, and in<br>
all cases the presents should be addressed and sent to the bride, who<br>
should acknowledge them by a prettily worded note of thanks as soon as<br>
the gifts are received or, at the latest, a few days after the marriage<br>
ceremony.<br>
<br>
<br>
Silver and Linen.<br>
<br>
The usual rule followed in the engraving of silver or the marking of<br>
linen is to use the initials of the bride's maiden name. The question of<br>
duplicate gifts is as annoying to the sender as it is to the young<br>
couple who are ultimately to enjoy the gifts. Theoretically, it is bad<br>
form to exchange a gift after it has been received, but, in truth, this<br>
is often done when a great deal of silver is given by close friends or<br>
members of the family it is a comparatively easy matter to find out what<br>
has already been sent and to learn the bride's wishes in this matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Prenuptial Functions.<br>
<br>
After the wedding invitations are out it is not customary for a girl to<br>
attend any social functions or to be much seen in public. This gives her<br>
the necessary time to devote to the finishing of her trousseau and for<br>
making any necessary arrangements for the new life she is to take up<br>
after the honeymoon is over. Family dinners are quite proper at this<br>
time, and it is expected of her to give a lunch to her bridesmaids. The<br>
wedding presents may be shown at this occasion, but any more public and<br>
general display of them is now rarely indulged in and is, in fact, not<br>
considered in good taste.<br>
<br>
The groom, as a prenuptial celebration, is supposed to give a supper to<br>
his intimate bachelor friends and the men who are to act as ushers at<br>
the marriage ceremony. The ushers are generally recruited from the<br>
friends of the groom rather than those of the bride, but if she has a<br>
grown brother he is always asked to act in this capacity. Ushers, like<br>
bridesmaids, are chosen among the unmarried friends of the young couple,<br>
although a matron of honor is often included in the bridal party.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bride's Trousseau.<br>
<br>
The bride's trousseau should be finished well before the fortnight<br>
preceding the wedding. Fashions change so quickly now that it is rarely<br>
advisable for a bride to provide gowns for more than a season ahead. If<br>
the check her father furnishes her for her trousseau is a generous one<br>
it is a wise provision to put a part of it aside for later use, and in<br>
so doing she has the equivalent of a wardrobe that will last her for a<br>
year or more.<br>
<br>
Custom has decreed that the bride's wedding dress shall be of pure<br>
white, and, as the marriage ceremony is a religious one, whether it<br>
takes place in a church or in a private house, that it shall be made<br>
high in the neck and with long sleeves. Orange blossoms, the natural<br>
flowers, form the trimming to the corsage and a coronet to fasten the<br>
veil. A bride's ornaments include only one gift of white jewelry, pearls<br>
or diamonds, from her future husband, and the bouquet he presents her.<br>
<br>
So many awkward moments have been occasioned in wedding ceremonies by<br>
removing the glove that brides are dispensing with wearing gloves at<br>
this time. The bride's appearance is by no means affected by this<br>
custom, and the slipping of the ring on the third finger of the left<br>
hand is made simpler and thereby more graceful. The engagement ring,<br>
which up to the time of the wedding ceremony has been worn on this<br>
finger, afterwards serves as a guard for the wedding ring.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Bridesmaids.<br>
<br>
Millinery is a most important question in discussing a wedding, and we<br>
cannot dismiss the question with the gown worn by the bride. A most<br>
serious consideration is what the bridesmaids are to wear, and this is<br>
generally only settled after long and serious consultation with the<br>
bride.<br>
<br>
It is generally agreed that all of these gowns shall be made by the same<br>
dressmaker so that they may conform to the colors and styles decided on,<br>
the gown of the maid or matron of honor differing slightly from the<br>
general scheme. At a church wedding bridesmaids wear hats and carry<br>
baskets or bouquets of flowers, but, if bouquets are carried, they<br>
should be quite unlike the one borne by the bride. It is customary for<br>
the bride to give her bridesmaids some souvenir of the occasion, and it<br>
is expected that the groom provide the gloves and ties for the ushers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Duties of the "Best Man."<br>
<br>
The duties of the "best man" are arduous, and it is indeed wise, as it<br>
is general, for a man to ask his best and most devoted friend to serve<br>
in this capacity. The best man is supposed to relieve the groom of all<br>
the details of the ceremony and to take on his shoulders all the worry<br>
incident to its success as a social function. It is he who purchases the<br>
gloves and ties for the other ushers and sees that they are coached in<br>
their duties; he procures the marriage license, if that is necessary,<br>
and has the ring ready for the groom at the critical moment. After the<br>
ceremony he is supposed to hand the clergyman his fee, and at the same<br>
time be in readiness to conduct the line of bridesmaids and ushers to<br>
their carriages. He must be at the bride's home, in case there is a<br>
wedding reception, before the principal actors in the ceremony are<br>
there. It is he who sends the notices of the event to the newspapers,<br>
and, if there is a formal breakfast with speech-making, it is the best<br>
man who proposes the health of the newly-married pair and replies to the<br>
toast in behalf of the bridesmaids. He is the one member of the wedding<br>
party who sees the happy couple off at the station and bids them the<br>
last farewell as they depart on their honeymoon. This is perhaps the<br>
time and moment when his good sense and social tact is the most needed,<br>
The foolish custom of decorating bridal baggage with white ribbon, and<br>
of throwing a superabundance of old shoes and a rain of rice after the<br>
departing pair, may be mitigated by a little care on his part.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MOURNING CUSTOMS.</span><br>
<br>
There has been of late years a healthy revolt against the excessive use<br>
of crepe or the wearing of mourning for an undue period. Mourning is<br>
first of all a protection, for in these busy days and in a large city a<br>
death affecting our acquaintances is not always known to us. If we meet<br>
a friend wearing black we are instantly apprised that she has suffered<br>
the loss of a near member of her family. It is easy to say under such<br>
circumstances, "I am very sorry to see you in black," or "I am afraid I<br>
have not heard of your loss."<br>
<br>
For a father or mother full mourning, that is, black unrelieved by any<br>
touch of white, is worn for a year, and at the end of that period half<br>
mourning, consisting first of white with black, and then violet and<br>
gray, is worn for the second year. For a brother or sister or<br>
grandparent black is worn for six months, and then half mourning for the<br>
six months preceding the wearing of ordinary colors. What is called<br>
complimentary mourning, put on at the death of a relative by marriage,<br>
consists of the wearing of black for a period of from six weeks to a<br>
year, depending on the closeness of the personal relationship. For<br>
instance, in the case of the death of a mother-in-law residing in a<br>
distant city, it would only be necessary for a woman to wear black for a<br>
few weeks following the funeral. If, on the other hand, she resides in<br>
the same place and is a great deal in the company of her husband's<br>
family, it would show more tact and affection on her part to refrain<br>
from wearing colors for a longer period.<br>
<br>
Crepe is no longer obligatory in even first mourning. Many widows only<br>
wear the crepe-bordered veil hanging from the conventional bonnet for<br>
the funeral services and for a few weeks afterward, when it is replaced<br>
by an ordinary hat and veil of plain black net bordered with thin black<br>
silk. Widows wear neck and cuff bands of unstarched white book muslin,<br>
this being the only sort of white permitted during the first period of<br>
mourning. Young widows, especially those who must lead an active life,<br>
often lighten their mourning during the second year and discard it at<br>
the end of the second year. Of course the conventional period of<br>
mourning for a widow is three years, but, if there should be any<br>
indication that a second marriage is contemplated, black should<br>
gradually be put aside.<br>
<br>
However, the discarding of mourning is no indication that a woman is<br>
about to change her name, and the wearing of black is so much a matter<br>
of personal feeling that a woman should not be criticised for curtailing<br>
the conventional period.<br>
<br>
In this country it is not the custom for young children to wear<br>
mourning, and with men the wearing of a black band about the hat or on<br>
the left arm is all that is deemed necessary.<br>
<br>
A woman wearing full mourning refrains from attending the theater or any<br>
large functions. She may properly be seen at concerts, club meetings or<br>
lectures, and she may receive and visit her friends informally.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ETIQUETTE OF THE VISITING CARD.</span><br>
<br>
The prevailing shape for a woman's card is nearly square (about 2-1/2 by<br>
3 inches), while the correct form for a man's card is slightly smaller.<br>
The color should be pure white with a dull finish, while the engraving,<br>
plain script or more elaborate text, is a matter of choice and fashion<br>
varying from time to time. It is safe to trust the opinion of a<br>
first-class stationer in this matter, for styles fluctuate, and he<br>
should be constantly informed of what polite usage demands.<br>
<br>
A woman's card should always bear the prefix "Miss" or "Mrs." There is<br>
no exception to this rule save in the case of women who have regularly<br>
graduated in medicine or theology and who are allowed therefore the use<br>
of "Dr." or "Rev." before the name. "Miss" or "Mrs." should not be used<br>
in addition to either of these titles.<br>
<br>
The card of a married woman is engraved with her husband's full name,<br>
such as Mrs. William Eaton Brown, but she has no right to any titles he<br>
may bear. If he is a judge or colonel she is still Mrs. James Eaton<br>
Brown and not Mrs. Judge or Mrs. Colonel Brown.<br>
<br>
A widow may with propriety retain the same visiting card that she used<br>
during the lifetime of her husband, especially if she has no grown son<br>
who bears his father's name. In that case she generally has her cards<br>
engraved with a part of her full maiden name before her husband's name,<br>
such as Mrs. Mary Baker Brown. In this country a divorced woman, if she<br>
has children, does not discard her husband's family name, neither does<br>
she retain his given name. For social purposes she becomes Mrs. Mary<br>
Baker Brown or, if she wishes, Mrs. Baker Brown.<br>
<br>
The address is engraved in the lower right corner of the visiting-card,<br>
and, if a woman has any particular day for receiving her friends, that<br>
fact is announced in the lower left corner. As a rule even informal<br>
notes should not be written on a visiting-card, although when a card<br>
accompanies a gift it is quite proper to write "Best wishes" or<br>
"Greetings" on it. This is even done when a card does not accompany a<br>
gift, but it should be borne in mind that a card message should not take<br>
the place of a note of thanks or be used when a more formal letter is<br>
necessary.<br>
<br>
A man's visiting-card should bear his full name with the prefix "Mr."<br>
unless he has a military title above the grade of lieutenant or is a<br>
doctor or clergyman. In these cases the proper title should be used in<br>
place of "Mr." Courtesy titles, although they may be common usage in<br>
conversation and a man may be known by them, are best abandoned on the<br>
visiting-card.<br>
<br>
During the first year of marriage cards are engraved thus:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Mr. and Mrs. William Eaton Brown</span></span><br>
<br>
and this card may be used in sending presents, returning wedding<br>
civilities or making calls, even when the bride is not accompanied by<br>
her husband. After the first year these cards are discarded, and husband<br>
and wife have separate visiting-cards.<br>
<br>
In some communities it is not the custom for a young girl to make formal<br>
calls without her mother. To meet this requirement the girl's name with<br>
the prefix "Miss" is engraved on her mother's card, below her mother's<br>
name.<br>
<br>
It is no longer considered necessary to leave a number of cards at the<br>
same house when calling in person or sending cards. If there are several<br>
women members of the family one card suffices. If a woman wishes to<br>
leave her husband's card she should leave two, one for the mistress and<br>
one for the man of the house. A woman never leaves a card for a man<br>
unless she has called on him on a matter of business and wishes him to<br>
be reminded of the fact.<br>
<br>
At a tea or large afternoon reception a card should be left in the hall<br>
as a guest departs, so as to enable the hostess to preserve a record of<br>
those who have called on her. If she is not able to attend she should<br>
send her visiting-card so that it may arrive on the day of the function.<br>
After a dinner or any formal function she should make a personal call or<br>
leave her card in person.<br>
<br>
When making an ordinary call it is not necessary to send one's<br>
visiting-card to the hostess by the servant who opens the door.<br>
Pronouncing the name distinctly is sufficient, but, if it is a first<br>
call, and there is danger that the hostess may not be familiar with the<br>
caller's address, it is best to leave a card on the hall table when<br>
leaving, no matter if the hostess herself conducts her visitor to the<br>
door.<br>
<br>
When one is invited but unable to attend a church wedding it is<br>
necessary to send, on the day of the ceremony, cards to those who issue<br>
the invitations. An invitation to a wedding reception or breakfast<br>
demands a more formal acceptance sent immediately on receipt of the<br>
invitation and couched in the same manner in which the invitation reads.<br>
<br>
A newcomer in town or a young married woman may receive a card from an<br>
older woman indicating her receiving days and hours. This is a polite<br>
invitation to call, and if she is unable to make a call at the time<br>
indicated she should send a card on that day.<br>
<br>
Cards of condolence are left as soon as possible after learning of the<br>
affliction. It is not necessary to write anything on the card; in fact,<br>
it is better not to do so, for, if the acquaintance warrants a personal<br>
message, it should take the form of a letter. On the other hand it is<br>
quite proper in felicitating a friend on a happy event, such as the<br>
announcement of an engagement in the family or the arrival of a new<br>
baby, to send a visiting-card with "Congratulations" written on it.<br>
<br>
There are times when it seems necessary to send cards to practically all<br>
one's acquaintances, This is wise after a long absence or a change of<br>
residence, and when one is leaving town for a long period it is proper<br>
to send cards with the French expression, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Pour prendre conge."</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FORMALITIES IN DRESS AND ETIQUETTE.</span><br>
<br>
"Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy" was old Polonius' advice to his<br>
son, and he counseled suitability as well. It is this question of<br>
suitability that is the hall mark of correct dressing. A safe rule to<br>
follow, especially in the case of a young woman, is not to be<br>
conspicuous in attire and to conform to the standards of dress as set<br>
down by older women of recognized standing in the town in which she<br>
lives and the community in which her social or business life is spent.<br>
<br>
A young girl needs little adorning. Her school or college dresses should<br>
be characterized by their neatness, freshness, correctness of cut and<br>
utility rather than by elaborate trimmings or costly materials. Her<br>
party gowns are simpler than those of a girl who has left school, and<br>
she wears less jewelry. At the end of school life, if her parents are<br>
able and willing to give her a coming-out party, she begins her social<br>
career under the pleasantest auspices, and this is the opportunity for<br>
her first elaborate gown.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Debutante.<br>
<br>
The character of this gown depends largely on the nature of the<br>
entertainment given her.<br>
<br>
It most commonly takes the form of an afternoon tea or reception to<br>
which her mother invites all of her friends as well as the younger set.<br>
The debutante receives with her mother and wears an elaborate frock of<br>
light material and color, made high in the neck and with elbow sleeves.<br>
Long white gloves are worn, and her hair is more elaborately arranged<br>
than it was during her school-girl period. In fact, she is now a full-<br>
fledged young lady and is dressed accordingly. Such a gown may serve<br>
later as an informal evening gown, or, if it is made with a detachable<br>
yoke, it may be worn as a dancing-frock or for any evening occasion for<br>
which a full evening gown is expected.<br>
<br>
The receiving party at an afternoon function generally includes near<br>
relatives of the debutante, and a number of her intimate girl friends<br>
are asked to assist in various ways. These receive with her and her<br>
mother in the early part of the afternoon and later assist at the tea<br>
table or mingle among the guests. The ladies assisting do not wear hats,<br>
and the young girls in the party are gowned much like the debutante,<br>
except that their gowns may be less elaborate if they choose, and they<br>
do not carry flowers.<br>
<br>
A popular girl or one with many family connections may count on a good<br>
many floral offerings on the occasion of her coming-out party. These are<br>
scattered about the room, either left in bunches or arranged in vases.<br>
One large bunch she generally carries in her left hand, and it is a wise<br>
girl who avoids singling out anyone of her men friends by carrying his<br>
flowers. A gift from her father or brother or the flowers sent by some<br>
friend of the family is the better choice. The success a girl makes<br>
during her first year in society depends more on her general popularity<br>
than on the devotion of any one man.<br>
<br>
<br>
Afternoon Reception.<br>
<br>
For an afternoon reception light refreshments, consisting of tea,<br>
coffee, chocolate, perhaps a light claret cup, with cakes and delicate<br>
sandwiches, are sufficient, and these are set out on a long table in a<br>
room adjoining the reception parlors.<br>
<br>
If a large number of guests are expected it is necessary to have a maid<br>
or two in attendance to remove cups and saucers, keep the tea urn<br>
replenished with hot water and to bring additional cakes and sandwiches<br>
if the supply on the table is in danger of running short. Two women<br>
friends are generally asked to preside at the refreshment table, one at<br>
each end to pour tea and chocolate, and, as this task is an arduous one<br>
and much of the success of the entertainment depends on its being well<br>
done, it is advisable to relieve the ladies in charge during the<br>
afternoon. This, however, like every other feature of the entertainment,<br>
should be arranged beforehand. The charm of an afternoon reception lies<br>
in its apparent informality, but every detail should be considered in<br>
advance and all contingencies provided for. The debutante, and<br>
especially her mother, should be relieved from all such responsibilities<br>
before the guests begin to come.<br>
<br>
The mother's duties consist in welcoming her guests and presenting her<br>
daughter to them. If many people are arriving the guests are quickly<br>
passed on to some one of the ladies assisting, whose duty it is to see<br>
that they meet some of those who are already in the room and are<br>
eventually asked to the tea table. A part of the receiving party, and<br>
certainly the hostess and her daughter, should remain together in a<br>
place where they may be easily found as the guests enter the room.<br>
<br>
No more sympathetic act of friendship can be shown a debutante than to<br>
contribute toward the success of her party. Girls who are asked to<br>
assist should remember that their first duty is not to entertain their<br>
own friends who may happen to be present, but to see that everyone is<br>
welcome and that especially those who are not acquainted with many in<br>
the room have an opportunity to become so. Anyone asked to assist at a<br>
function of this sort is in a sense a hostess, and it is quite within<br>
her province to enter into conversation with any unoccupied guest<br>
whether she has been introduced or not.<br>
<br>
The usual hours for an afternoon tea are from four to six, but in the<br>
case of a coming-out reception the hour is often prolonged to seven so<br>
as to allow more men to be present than would be the case if the time<br>
were restricted to the early afternoon. In these busy days few men are<br>
at liberty to make afternoon calls, and it is always a compliment to a<br>
girl if her tea includes a sprinkling of black coats. Whatever hours are<br>
decided on, they should be engraved on the cards sent out two weeks<br>
before the tea. These are of the form and size of an ordinary<br>
visiting-card and include the daughter's name below that of her<br>
mother's. If she is the eldest unmarried daughter or the only girl in<br>
the family the card reads as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Mrs. Geo. Baker

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&nbsp; 4 to 7
o'clock</span><br>
<br>
The daughter's given name is only used in case she has an older<br>
unmarried sister.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ball and Evening Reception.<br>
<br>
A more elaborate form of coming-out party consists of a ball or of an<br>
evening reception followed by dancing, and in this case the card<br>
contains the word "Dancing" below the date of the entertainment and the<br>
hours at which it is given. Few homes are large enough to provide for<br>
even a small dance, and so a party of this sort is generally given at a<br>
hotel. The guests as well as the receiving party wear evening gowns<br>
without hats, and men are expected to come in full evening clothes,<br>
which means the long-tailed coats and not the popular Tuxedo, white<br>
gloves, and, although this is not obligatory, white waistcoats.<br>
<br>
After a girl has been introduced into society she has her individual<br>
visiting-cards, makes her own calls and is allowed to receive her own<br>
friends. Social customs differ with locality, and the chaperon is less<br>
customary in the West than in the East. In many cities girls are allowed<br>
to go to the theater and to evening parties with a man friend without a<br>
married woman being included in the party. A wise girl, however, is<br>
careful that any man she meets shall be introduced as soon as possible<br>
to some older member of her family and to introduce a young man calling<br>
for the first time to either her mother or father. Also when she accepts<br>
an invitation to an evening's entertainment she insists that her escort<br>
shall call for her at her own home and bring her directly home at the<br>
close of it. Dining or supping at a restaurant alone with a young man is<br>
sure to expose a girl to criticism.<br>
<br>
<br>
A Woman's Lunch.<br>
<br>
There are many pleasant forms of entertainment offered to a young girl<br>
entering society in which men are not included, and the most popular of<br>
these is a woman's lunch. This is a favorite form of entertainment for a<br>
young married woman to give in honor of some girl friend who has just<br>
come out in society or whose engagement has just been announced. One<br>
o'clock or half after is the usual hour, and the meal is served in<br>
courses and is as elaborate as the household resources may allow. The<br>
decorations of the table are important, and three courses are sufficient<br>
if they are carefully arranged. Handsome street costumes are worn for a<br>
function of this sort, and the guest of honor, if there is one, dresses<br>
as the others do. Outer wraps are left in the hall or in a room put<br>
aside for this purpose, and, as a rule, hats are retained and gloves<br>
removed when the guests sit down at table.<br>
<br>
The custom of wearing a hat during lunch is not an arbitrary one, and it<br>
is not universal. In France, for example, where social customs are most<br>
carefully observed, it is the custom to wear handsome afternoon gowns if<br>
invited for the noon meal and to remove hats. The noon meal there is a<br>
social function, and certain formalities are observed. In London, on the<br>
contrary, no matter if a number of guests are expected, lunch is an<br>
informal occasion, and women dress for lunch as they would for an<br>
afternoon tea.<br>
<br>
Hats are worn and women are prepared to rush off afterwards to meet<br>
other engagements. The English custom prevails now in the large cities<br>
in America, and, moreover, women seem disinclined to remove their hats<br>
after they are once dressed for the round of the day's social<br>
obligations.<br>
<br>
It is simpler and really quite conventional to leave the wearing of hats<br>
to the individual. The hostess should ask her guest if she wishes to<br>
take her hat off or retain it, and she can at the same time intimate to<br>
her guest, if she is a stranger in the town, what the others will<br>
probably do in this connection. True hospitality on the part of the<br>
hostess is to make her guests at ease, and true politeness on the part<br>
of the visitor is to conform to the rules governing the community that<br>
she is visiting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PROPER APPAREL FOR MEN.</span><br>
<br>
American gentlemen are no longer dependent on English tailors or on<br>
English fashions as they were some years ago. The American type of<br>
physique is a distinct one, and London tailors have never been able to<br>
fit American men as well as they do their own clients. Moreover social<br>
life is so different in the United States from what it is in England<br>
that men really need different clothes.<br>
<br>
Practically all American men are business men for the working hours of<br>
the day, and few of them have any time or inclination for anything save<br>
business clothes while daylight lasts. For dinner or for the evening<br>
what are generally called evening clothes are permissible, and in fact<br>
obligatory in large cities for anything beyond the most informal home<br>
functions.<br>
<br>
For the evening there is the informal and formal dress suit. The former<br>
consists of the long-tailed coat worn with either a white or black<br>
waistcoat. For a dancing party or formal dinner the white waistcoat is<br>
generally preferred, and, if it is worn, it must be accompanied by a<br>
white lawn tie. A made-up bow is considered incorrect. The<br>
accompaniments to a suit of this sort are patent-leather shoes and white<br>
kid gloves if dancing is a part of the evening programme.<br>
<br>
The informal evening suit includes the shorter dinner jacket or Tuxedo,<br>
as it was formerly called, and, strictly speaking, this is only<br>
considered proper for the club or for parties where ladies are not<br>
expected to be present. However, men who commonly dress for dinner in<br>
the home circle generally prefer the dinner jacket to the long coat, and<br>
well-dressed men are often seen wearing it at small dinner parties, at<br>
the theater or at any informal evening event. This coat is always worn<br>
with a black tie and waistcoat, and it is not a suitable apparel for a<br>
dance or any large formal evening affair.<br>
<br>
The correct dress for a daytime wedding is a black frock coat with light<br>
trousers, light fancy waistcoat and gray gloves and gray Ascot or<br>
four-in-hand tie, and the frock coat with black waistcoat proper for<br>
church or when making afternoon calls. Many young men are adopting for<br>
afternoon wear the English morning suit, which consists of a cutaway<br>
coat with trousers and waistcoat to match and made of some other color<br>
save black.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO SELECT COLORS</span><br>
<br>
The Natural Laws of Tints, Tones, Shades and Hues.<br>
<br>
Some combinations of color are pleasing to the eye, and some are<br>
discordant. The reasons for this are based on natural laws and are<br>
explained in a very simple manner in a learned article by Dr. W. K. Carr<br>
which originally appeared in Shop Notes Quarterly. Impressions continue<br>
upon the retina of the eye, says Dr. Carr, about one-sixth of a second<br>
after the object has been moved. For this reason a point of light or<br>
flame whirled swiftly around appears as a continuous ring. Or take a<br>
piece or red ribbon, place it on white paper, look intently at it for<br>
thirty seconds and suddenly remove the ribbon. The portion of the paper<br>
which was covered by the ribbon will then appear green. The explanation<br>
is that the color sensation in the eye is caused by the almost<br>
unthinkably rapid whirling of electrons around their atoms, and that the<br>
retina, becoming fatigued by the vibration of the red, is therefore less<br>
sensitive to them. When the ribbon is suddenly removed, the eye sees,<br>
not the blue, yellow and red which produce the white surface of the<br>
paper, but, because of the fatigue of the eye to the red, it sees only<br>
the blue and yellow constituents of the white light. But blue and yellow<br>
produce green; hence the tendency at the eye to see the complementary of<br>
a color. This may be referred to as the "successive contrast of colors."<br>
<br>
<br>
Colors for Blondes and for Brunettes.<br>
<br>
Now, for a practical application of this knowledge.<br>
<br>
The hair of the blond is a mixture of red, yellow and brown. As a rule<br>
the skin is lighter, that is, it contains not so much orange, and the<br>
tinges of red are lighter. Nature, therefore, very properly made the<br>
blond's eyes blue, since the blue is complementary to the orange of her<br>
hair.<br>
<br>
The brunette's skin, on the other hand, has more orange in it, and hence<br>
a color favorable to one would not be becoming to the other.<br>
<br>
What would be the effect of green upon a complexion deficient in red? It<br>
would certainly heighten the rose tints in the cheeks, but the greatest<br>
care should be exercised in the selection of the proper shade of green,<br>
because the brunette's complexion contains a great deal of orange, and<br>
the green, acting upon the red of the orange, could readily produce a<br>
brick-dust appearance. Green, therefore, is a risky color for a<br>
brunette, and so is violet, which would neutralize the yellow of the<br>
orange and heighten the red. But if the orange complexion had more<br>
yellow than red, then the association of violet would produce pallor.<br>
Yellow, of course, is her color, since its complementary violet<br>
neutralizes the yellow of the orange complexion and leaves the red.<br>
<br>
But with the yellow-haired blond the conditions are very different. The<br>
complementary of blue is orange, which improves the hair and freshens<br>
the light flesh tints. A blond, therefore can wear blue, just as a<br>
brunette can wear yellow.<br>
<br>
In arranging flowers the same law holds. Complementary colors should be<br>
placed side by side; blue with orange, yellow with violet, red and rose<br>
with green leaves. And anyone who successfully selects his wall paper<br>
and house furnishings is drawing unconsciously, perhaps, on an intuitive<br>
knowledge of these fundamental facts. Dark papers are bad, especially in<br>
rooms with a northern exposure, because they absorb too much light. The<br>
complementaries of red and violet are exceedingly trying to most<br>
complexions, and orange and orange-yellow are fatiguing to the eye. The<br>
most pleasing effects are to be had with yellow, light blue and light<br>
green, for the latter freshens the red in pale skins, and the blue<br>
heightens blond complexions, and goes well with gilding and with<br>
mahogany and cherry furniture.<br>
<br>
<br>
COLOR CONTRAST AND HARMONY.<br>
<br>
The following tables will be found useful in selecting colors for dress,<br>
decoration, or any other purpose in which the proper application of the<br>
true laws of contrast and harmony in color is desirable:<br>
<br>
Contrasts in Color.<br>
<br>
Yellow contrasts with--<br>
Purple, russet, and auburn.<br>
Red contrasts with--<br>
Green, olive, and drab.<br>
Blue contrasts with--<br>
Orange, citrine, and buff.<br>
<br>
Harmonies in Color.<br>
<br>
Yellow harmonizes with--<br>
Orange, green, citrine, russet, buff, and drab.<br>
Red harmonizes with--<br>
Orange, purple, russet, citrine, auburn, and buff.<br>
Blue harmonizes with--<br>
Purple, green, olive, citrine, drab, and auburn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE CARE OF THE TEETH.</span><br>
<br>
Decay of the teeth, or caries, commences externally, appearing upon the<br>
enamel or bony structure of the teeth. Usually it is the result of<br>
chemical action produced by decomposition of food. Acids found in some<br>
fruits will cause decay if allowed to remain in contact with the teeth.<br>
Then there are the natural mouth acids, which, although not strong, are<br>
none the less effective if allowed to remain long enough around the<br>
teeth. Microscopical examinations have shown that the secretions of<br>
almost every person's month contain more or less vegetable and animal<br>
life that will withstand the application of acids and astringents and<br>
will only succumb to alkalies. A dentifrice or mouth wash should be<br>
alkaline.<br>
<br>
<br>
Toothache.<br>
<br>
Toothache is not always due to an exposed nerve, for in the majority of<br>
teeth extracted because they are painful the nerve is dead. Inflammation<br>
is often the cause of the trouble.<br>
<br>
A toothache due to inflammation is a steady, aggravating pain,<br>
overspreading the affected side of the face, sometimes even the neck and<br>
shoulder. As there is no nerve to kill in a case of this kind, the tooth<br>
should be treated until cured, or removed upon the first symptom of<br>
trouble. Its extraction would be unattended by any danger and would<br>
afford welcome relief.<br>
<br>
Tartar, a creamy, calcareous deposit, supposed to be from the saliva,<br>
will sometimes cause toothache. It accumulates around the necks of the<br>
teeth and eventually becomes hard and dark-colored. It also causes foul<br>
breath and loosens the gums from the teeth, causing them to present an<br>
unsightly appearance.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Teeth of Children.<br>
<br>
Children have twenty temporary teeth, which begin making their<br>
appearance about the sixth or seventh month. The time varies in<br>
different children. This is the most dangerous and troublesome period of<br>
the child's existence, and every parent will do well to consult a<br>
reputable dentist. About the second or third year the temporary teeth<br>
are fully developed. They require the same care to preserve them as is<br>
exercised toward the permanent set.<br>
<br>
About the sixth year, or soon after, four permanent molars, or double<br>
teeth, make their appearance. Some parents mistakenly suppose these<br>
belong to the first set. It is a serious error. They are permanent<br>
teeth, and if lost will be lost forever. No teeth that come after the<br>
sixth year are ever shed. Let every parent remember this.<br>
<br>
At twelve years the second set is usually complete, with the exception<br>
of the wisdom teeth, which appear anywhere from the eighteenth to the<br>
twenty-fourth year. When the second set is coming in the beauty and<br>
character of the child's countenance is completed or forever spoiled.<br>
Everything depends upon proper care at this time to see that the teeth<br>
come with regularity and are not crowded together. The teeth cannot have<br>
too much room. When a little separated they are less liable to decay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dentifrices--Useful and Injurious.<br>
<br>
The habit of caring for the teeth daily, and if possible after each<br>
meal, should be established early in life.<br>
<br>
Those who have neglected to do so should lose no time in consulting a<br>
reputable dentist, and then persistently caring for their teeth day by<br>
day. Children especially should be taught to use the tooth-brush and<br>
some reliable dentifrice. The more pleasant the preparation the easier<br>
it will be to teach them its daily use. A fragrant, refreshing liquid is<br>
recommended, as it is a mouth wash as well as a tooth cleanser. The<br>
habit thus formed, neglected for even a single day, will make the mouth<br>
feel decidedly uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cleansing the Teeth.<br>
<br>
Preparations for cleansing the teeth and purifying the mouth should be<br>
free from all acids, and should be saponaceous or soapy, containing as<br>
one of the principal ingredients an alkali to neutralize the acids and<br>
destroy the animal and vegetable parasites which, as the microscope<br>
would show us, are in the secretions of almost every person's mouth.<br>
<br>
A finely triturated powder having slight abrasive properties, but free<br>
from dangerous grit, should be used as the complement of a liquid. One<br>
way to use both is to pour on the wet brush or into the palm of the hand<br>
a sufficient quantity of powder and moisten it with the liquid.<br>
Occasionally the powder or the liquid alone could be employed. Be<br>
careful to use a liquid and powder of established reputation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Beware of thy teeth.<br>
&nbsp; Take good care of thy teeth,<br>
&nbsp; And they will take good care of thee.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE PERFECT FEMALE FIGURE.</span><br>
<br>
According to the Chicago Tribune, Miss Helen Loewe, a student at the<br>
Chicago Art Institute, is credited by art critics with closely<br>
approaching the standard of physical perfection set by statues of the<br>
goddess Venus. Miss Loewe was posed as a model for a series of<br>
photographs issued for the benefit of the playground fund of Oak Park.<br>
<br>
Aside from the artistic nature of Miss Loewe, a comparison of<br>
measurements with those of the typically perfect figure explains part of<br>
the success of these photographic studies.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">MEN AND COMPLEXIONS.</span><br>
<br>
Dr. Katherine Blackford, of Boston, speaking of men's complexions,<br>
arrives at the following conclusions. There are, of course, exceptions<br>
to all rules: "As a general rule, the blonds are inconstant. They change<br>
their minds too often. They get angry one moment and forgive the next.<br>
They are impulsive, and when they do commit crimes they are done on the<br>
impulse of the moment. A blond radiates his personality about him. The<br>
brunette, on the other hand as a rule, likes to concentrate on one<br>
subject. He is a specialist. He prefers his home and family, and his<br>
pleasures are more often lectures and kindred entertainments than those<br>
of a lighter order. He learns slowly, but he retains what he knows far<br>
better than does the blond."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW THE BABY'S MIND DEVELOPS.</span><br>
<br>
In his book on "The Development of the Intellect," Mr. H. W. Brown<br>
presents a conspectus of the observations of Prof. Preyer on the mind of<br>
the child which shows chronologically the gradual development of the<br>
senses, intellect and will of the growing child and presents in a<br>
condensed form the result of a great number of careful observations.<br>
<br>
It is recorded that sensibility to light, touch, temperature, smell and<br>
taste are present on the first day of infant life. Hearing, therefore,<br>
is the only special sense which is not active at this time. The child<br>
hears by the third or fourth day. Taste and smell are senses at the<br>
first most active, but they are differentiated. General organic<br>
sensations of well being or discomfiture are felt from the first, but<br>
pain and pleasure as mental states are not noted till at or near the<br>
second month.<br>
<br>
The first sign of speech in the shape of utterance of consonant sounds<br>
is heard about the end of the second month, these consonants being<br>
generally "m," "r," "g," or "t." All the movements of the eyes become<br>
co-ordinate by the fourth month, and by this time the child begins to<br>
have the "feeling of self," that is, he looks at his own hands and looks<br>
at himself in the mirror. The study of the child's mind during the first<br>
year shows conclusively that ideas develop and reasoning processes occur<br>
before there is any knowledge of words or of language; though it may be<br>
assumed that the child thinks in symbols, visual or auditory, which are<br>
clumsy equivalents for words. By the end of the year the child begins to<br>
express itself by sounds--that is, speech begins. The development of<br>
this speech capacity is, according to Preyer, in accordance with the<br>
development of the intellectual powers. By the end of the second year<br>
the child's power of speech is practically acquired.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE WONDERFUL HUMAN BRAIN.</span><br>
<br>
According to the novel computations of a renowned histologist, who has<br>
been calculating the aggregate cell forces of the human brain, the<br>
cerebral mass is composed of at least 300,000,000 of nerve cells, each<br>
an independent body, organism, and microscopic brain so far as concerns<br>
its vital functions, but subordinate to a higher purpose in relation to<br>
the functions of the organ; each living a separate life individually,<br>
though socially subject to a higher law of function.<br>
<br>
The lifetime of a nerve cell he estimates to be about sixty days, so<br>
that 5,000,000 die every day, about 200,000 every hour, and nearly 3,500<br>
every minute, to be succeeded by an equal number of their progeny; while<br>
once in every sixty days a man has a new brain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MOURNING COLORS THE WORLD OVER.</span><br>
<br>
Black is by no means the only color used by man to express grief or<br>
mourning for the dead. In the South Sea Islands the natives express<br>
sorrow and hope by stripes of black and white. Grayish brown, the color<br>
of the earth to which the dead return, is used in Ethiopia. Pale brown,<br>
the color of withered leaves, is the mourning of Persia. Sky-blue, to<br>
express the assured hope that the deceased has gone to heaven, is the<br>
mourning of Syria, Cappadocia, and Armenia. Deep blue in Bokhara. Purple<br>
and violet, to express "kings and queens to God," was the color of<br>
mourning for cardinals and kings of France. The color of mourning in<br>
Turkey is violet. White (emblem of hope) is the color of mourning in<br>
China. Henry VIII. wore white for Anne Boleyn. The ladies of ancient<br>
Rome and Sparta wore white. It was the color of mourning in Spain till<br>
1498. Yellow is the color of mourning in Egypt and in Burmah. Anne<br>
Boleyn wore yellow mourning for Catharine of Aragon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CURIOUS FACTS ABOUT HAIR.</span><br>
<br>
The hair of men is finer than that of women.<br>
<br>
The average weight of a head of hair is from 5 to 12 ounces.<br>
<br>
On an average head there are about 1,000 hairs to the square inch.<br>
<br>
Hair will stretch about one-fourth of its length and retract nearly to<br>
its original length.<br>
<br>
Four hairs of good strength will hold suspended a one-pound weight. A<br>
single head of hair, of average growth, would therefore hold suspended<br>
an entire audience of 200 people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THINGS THAT ARE MISNAMED</span><br>
<br>
Catgut is gut of sheep.<br>
<br>
Baffin's Bay is no bay at all.<br>
<br>
Arabic figures were invented by the Indians.<br>
<br>
Turkish baths are not of Turkish origin.<br>
<br>
Blacklead is a compound of carbon and iron.<br>
<br>
Slave by derivation should mean noble, illustrious.<br>
<br>
Turkeys do not come from Turkey, but North America.<br>
<br>
Titmouse is not a mouse, but a little hedge sparrow.<br>
<br>
Dutch clocks are of German (Deutsch), not Dutch manufacture.<br>
<br>
Salt (that is table salt) is not a salt at all, but "chloride of<br>
sodium."<br>
<br>
Galvanized iron is not galvanized--simply iron coated with zinc.<br>
<br>
Ventriloquism is not voice from the stomach, but from the mouth.<br>
<br>
Kid gloves are not kid at all, but are made of lambskin or sheepskin.<br>
<br>
Pompey's Pillar, in Alexandria, was erected neither by nor to Pompey.<br>
<br>
Tonquin beans come from Tonka, in Guinea, not Tonquin, in Asia.<br>
<br>
Fire, air, earth, and water, called the four elements, are not elements<br>
at all.<br>
<br>
Rice paper is not made from rice, but from the pith of Tungtsau, or<br>
hollowplant.<br>
<br>
Japan lacquer contains no lac at all, but is made from the resin of a<br>
kind of nut tree.<br>
<br>
Pen means a feather. (Latin. "penna," a wing.) A steel pen is therefore<br>
an anomaly.<br>
<br>
Jerusalem artichoke has no connection with Jerusalem, but with the<br>
sunflower, "girasole."<br>
<br>
Humble pie, for "umbil pie." The umbils of venison were served to<br>
inferiors and servants.<br>
<br>
Lunar caustic is simply nitrate of silver, and silver is the<br>
astrological symbol of the moon.<br>
<br>
Bridegroom has nothing to do with groom. It is the old English "guma," a<br>
man, "bryd-guma."<br>
<br>
Mother of pearl is the inner layer of several sorts of shell, and in<br>
some cases the matrix of the pearl.<br>
<br>
Sealing wax is not wax at all nor does it contain wax. It is made of<br>
shellac, Venice turpentine and cinnabar.<br>
<br>
Cleopatra's Needles were not erected by Cleopatra, nor in honor of that<br>
queen, but by Thothmes III.<br>
<br>
German silver is not silver at all, but a metallic mixture which has<br>
been in use in China time out of mind.<br>
<br>
Cuttle-bone is not bone, but a structure of pure chalk imbedded loosely<br>
in the substance of a species of cuttlefish.<br>
<br>
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, a naval astronomer of<br>
Florence, but he did not discover the New World.<br>
<br>
Prussian blue does not come from Prussia. It is the precipitate of the<br>
salt of protoxide of iron with red prussiate of potass.<br>
<br>
Wormwood has nothing to do with worms or wood; it is the Anglo-Saxon<br>
"wer mod," man-inspiriting, being a strong tonic.<br>
<br>
Honeydew is neither honey nor dew, but an animal substance given off by<br>
certain insects, especially when hunted by ants.<br>
<br>
Gothic architecture is not that of the Goths, but the ecclesiastical<br>
style employed in England and France before the Renaissance.<br>
<br>
Sperm oil properly means "seed oil," from the notion that it was spawn<br>
or milt of a whale. It is chiefly taken, however, from the head, not the<br>
spawn of the "spermaceti" whale.<br>
<br>
Whalebone is not bone, nor does it possess any properties of bone. It is<br>
a substance attached to the upper jaw of the whale, and serves to strain<br>
the water which the creature takes up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LANGUAGE OF THE FLAG.</span><br>
<br>
To "strike a flag" is to lower the national colors in token of<br>
submission.<br>
<br>
Flags are used as the symbol of rank and command, the officers using<br>
them being called flag officers. Such flags are square, to distinguish<br>
them from other banners.<br>
<br>
A "flag of truce" is a white flag displayed to an enemy to indicate a<br>
desire to parley or for consultation.<br>
<br>
The white flag is a sign of peace. After a battle parties from both<br>
sides often go out to the field to rescue the wounded or bury dead under<br>
the protection of a white flag.<br>
<br>
The red flag is a sign of defiance, and is often used by revolutionists.<br>
In the naval service it is a mark of danger, and shows a vessel to be<br>
receiving or discharging her powder.<br>
<br>
The black flag is a sign of piracy.<br>
<br>
The yellow flag shows a vessel to be at quarantine or is the sign of a<br>
contagious disease.<br>
<br>
A flag at half-mast means mourning. Fishing and other vessels return<br>
with a flag at half-mast to announce the loss or death of some of the<br>
men.<br>
<br>
Dipping the flag is lowering it slightly and then hoisting it again to<br>
salute a vessel or fort.<br>
<br>
If the President of the United States goes afloat the American flag is<br>
carried in the bows of his barge or hoisted at the main of the vessel on<br>
board of which he is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DEATH SENTENCE OF THE SAVIOR.</span><br>
<br>
The following is said to be the sentence of death, word for word,<br>
pronounced against Jesus Christ:<br>
<br>
Sentence pronounced by Pontius Pilate, intendent of the lower province<br>
of Galilee, that Jesus of Nazareth shall suffer death by the cross. In<br>
the seventeenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, and on the 24th<br>
day of the month, in the most holy city of Jerusalem, during the<br>
pontificate of Annas and Caiaphas.<br>
<br>
Pontius Pilate, intendent of the Province of Lower Galilee, sitting to<br>
judgment in the presidential seat of the Praetors, sentences Jesus of<br>
Nazareth to death on a cross between robbers, as the numerous and<br>
notorious testimonies of the people prove:<br>
<br>
1. Jesus is a misleader.<br>
<br>
2. He has excited the people to sedition.<br>
<br>
3. He is an enemy to the laws.<br>
<br>
4. He calls himself the son of God.<br>
<br>
5. He calls himself, falsely, the King of Israel.<br>
<br>
6. He went to the temple followed by a multitude carrying palms in their<br>
hands. Orders from the first centurion Quirrillis Cornelius to bring him<br>
to the place of execution. Forbids all persons, rich or poor, to prevent<br>
the execution of Jesus.<br>
<br>
The witnesses who have signed the execution of Jesus are:<br>
<br>
1. Daniel Robani, Pharisee.<br>
<br>
2. John Zorobabic.<br>
<br>
3. Raphael Robani.<br>
<br>
4. Capet.<br>
<br>
Jesus is to be taken out of Jerusalem through the gate of Tournes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE HORSE'S PRAYER.</span><br>
<br>
To thee, my master, I offer my prayer: Feed, water and care for me; and<br>
when the day's work is done, provide me with shelter and a clean, dry<br>
bed. Always be kind to me. Pet me sometimes, that I may serve you the<br>
more gladly and learn to love you. Do not jerk the reins, and do not<br>
whip me when going up hill. Never strike, beat or kick me when I do not<br>
understand what you want, but give me a chance to understand you. Watch<br>
me, and if I fail to do your bidding, see if something is not wrong with<br>
my harness or feet.<br>
<br>
Do not overload me or hitch me where water will drip on me. Keep me well<br>
shod. Examine my teeth when I do not eat; I may have an ulcerated tooth,<br>
and that, you know, is painful. Do not tie or check my head in an<br>
unnatural position or take away my best defence against flies and<br>
mosquitoes by cutting off my mane or tail.<br>
<br>
I cannot tell you when I am thirsty, so give me clean, cool water often.<br>
I cannot tell you in words when I am sick, so watch me and by signs you<br>
may know my condition. Give me all possible shelter from the hot sun,<br>
and put a blanket on me not when I am working, but when I am standing in<br>
the cold. Never put a frosty bit in my mouth; first warm it by holding<br>
it in your hands.<br>
<br>
I try to carry you and your burdens without a murmur, and wait patiently<br>
for you long hours of the day or night. Without the power to choose my<br>
shoes or path, I sometimes fall on the hard pavements, and I must be<br>
ready at any moment to lose my life in your service.<br>
<br>
And finally, O, my master, when my useful strength is gone, do not turn<br>
me out to starve or freeze, nor sell me to some human brute to be slowly<br>
tortured and starved to death, but do thou, my master, take my life in<br>
the kindest way, and your God will reward you here and hereafter. Amen.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">HINTS ON SHAVING.</span><br>
<br>
Learn to shave right.<br>
<br>
Don't shave in a hurry.<br>
<br>
Have the water hot enough so that it won't cool too quickly.<br>
<br>
Wash the face with soap and hot water before lathering, especially if<br>
the beard is hard.<br>
<br>
Have the lather very soapy--thin enough to spread easily, yet thick<br>
enough so it won't drop. Rub well into the face with the brush, then<br>
with the fingers. The longer you lather and the more you rub, the easier<br>
the shave.<br>
<br>
The hair usually grows downward. Shave with the grain, not against it.<br>
Use a sliding motion, as well as downward.<br>
<br>
If you get a "nick," wash with cold water. Rubbing the cut with a piece<br>
of lump alum will stop the bleeding at once and help to heal.<br>
<br>
Hold the razor properly. Lay it as flat as possible--the back of razor<br>
nearly touching the skin. Have it under easy control. Don't grab it--an<br>
easy position means an easy shave.<br>
<br>
A poor strop will spoil the best razor ever made.<br>
<br>
To buy a good razor and a cheap strop is pour economy.<br>
<br>
If you prefer a swing strop, pull it as tightly as you can. Better use a<br>
stiff strop--cushion or solid--if in doubt.<br>
<br>
A serious mistake made by a number of self-shavers is to hold the strop<br>
loose. This bends the invisible teeth and rounds the edge.<br>
<br>
Strop your razor before and after shaving. This keeps the edge free from<br>
rust.<br>
<br>
Dip your razor in hot water before stropping and shaving. This dissolves<br>
the accumulation in the invisible teeth.<br>
<br>
Press as hard as you like on the back of the blade, but very lightly on<br>
the edge.<br>
<br>
As you reach the end of the strop, turn the razor on the back of the<br>
blade to strop the other side, pulling toward you.<br>
<br>
Keep rust away from your strop, and remember that a cut in the strop<br>
will ruin your razor. Don't use a strop that is cut.<br>

The Great Eastern, at one time the greatest steamer afloat, and twice as<br>
long as any other vessel at the time of her launching, in 1858, was 692<br>
feet in length and 118 feet in breadth. She was too large to be handled<br>
profitably with the motive power then available, but proved<br>
indispensable in the laying of the Atlantic cable. She was broken up and<br>
sold as junk, although the Isherwood system, on which she was built, has<br>
since been revived, and is now successfully employed in shipbuilding.<br>

"Moncky." Charles Moncky, the inventor of it, sold his patent for<br>
$2,000, and invested the money in a house in Williamsburgh, Kings<br>
County, N. Y.<br>

Alexandria, Walls and Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Temple of Diana at<br>
Ephesus, the Statue of the Olympian Jupiter, Mausoleum of Artemisia, and<br>
Colossus of Rhodes.<br>
<br>
In 1775 there were only twenty-seven newspapers published in the United<br>
States. Ten years later, in 1785, there were seven published in the<br>
English language in Philadelphia alone, of which one was a daily. The<br>
oldest newspaper published in Philadelphia at the time of the Federal<br>
convention was the Pennsylvania Gazette, established by Samuel Keimer,<br>
in 1728. The second newspaper in point of age was the Pennsylvania<br>
Journal, established in 1742 by William Bradford, whose uncle, Andrew<br>
Bradford, established the first newspaper in Pennsylvania, the American<br>
Weekly Mercury, in 1719. Next in age, but the first in importance, was<br>
the Pennsylvania Packet, established by John Dunlap, in 1771. In 1784 it<br>
became a daily, being the first daily newspaper printed on this<br>
continent.<br>
<br>
"Liberty," Bartholdi's statue, presented to the United States by the<br>
French people in 1885, is the largest statue ever built. Its conception<br>
is due to the great French sculptor whose name it bears. It is said to<br>
be a likeness of his mother. Eight years of time were consumed in the<br>
construction of this gigantic brazen image. Its weight is 440,000<br>
pounds, of which 146,000 pounds are copper, the remainder iron and<br>
steel. The major part of the iron and steel was used in constructing the<br>
skeleton frame work for the inside. The mammoth electric light held in<br>
the hands of the giantess is 305 feet above tide-water. The height of<br>
the figure is 152-1/2 feet; the pedestal 91 feet, and the foundation 52<br>
feet and 10 inches. Forty persons can find standing-room within the<br>
mighty head, which is 14-1/2 feet in diameter. A six-foot man standing<br>
on the lower lip could hardly reach the eyes. The index finger is 8 feet<br>
in length and the nose 3-3/4 feet. The Colossus of Rhodes was a pigmy<br>
compared with this latter-day wonder.<br>
<br>
The largest and grandest temple of worship in the world is St. Peter's<br>
Cathedral at Rome. It stands on the site of Nero's circus, in the<br>
northwest part of the city, and is built in form of a Latin cross. The<br>
total length of the interior is 612-1/2 English feet; transept, 446-1/2<br>
feet; height of nave, 152-1/2 feet; diameter of cupola, 193 feet; height<br>
of dome from pavement to top of cross, 448 feet. The great bell alone,<br>
without the hammer or clapper, weighs 18,600 pounds, or over 9-1/4 tons.<br>
The foundation was laid in 1450 A. D. Forty-three Popes lived and died<br>
during the time the work was in progress. It was dedicated in the year<br>
1826, but not entirely finished until the year 1880. The cost, in round<br>
numbers, is set down at $70,000,000.<br>
<br>
The great pyramid of Cheops is the largest structure of any kind ever<br>
erected by the hand of man. Its original dimensions at the base were 764<br>
feet square, and its perpendicular height in the highest point 488 feet;<br>
it covers four acres, one rood and twenty-two perches of ground and has<br>
been estimated by an eminent English architect to have cost not less<br>
than 30,000,000 pounds, which in United States currency would be about<br>
$145,200,000. Internal evidence proves that the great pyramid was begun<br>
about the year 2170 B. c., about the time of the birth of Abraham. It is<br>
estimated that about 5,000,000 tons of hewn stone were used in its<br>
construction, and the evidence points to the fact that these stones were<br>
brought a distance of about 700 miles from quarries in Arabia.<br>
<br>
The largest body of fresh water in the world is Lake Superior. It is 400<br>
miles long and 180 miles wide; its circumference, including the winding<br>
of its various bays, has been estimated at 1,800 miles. Its area in<br>
square miles is 32,000, which is greater than the whole of New England,<br>
leaving out Maine. The greatest depth of this inland sea is 200 fathoms,<br>
or 1,200 feet. Its average depth is about 160 fathoms. It is 636 feet<br>
above the sea level.<br>
<br>
The corner stone of the Washington monument, the highest in the United<br>
States, and until 1889 the highest structure in the world, was laid July<br>
4, 1848. Robert E. Winthrop, then Speaker of the House, delivered the<br>
oration. Work progressed steadily for about six years, until the funds<br>
of the monumental society became exhausted. At that time the monument<br>
was about 175 feet high. From 1854 until 1879 nothing to speak of was<br>
done on the building. In the year last above named Congress voted an<br>
appropriation of $200,000 to complete the work. From that time forward<br>
work progressed at a rapid rate until December 6th, 1884, when the<br>
aluminum apex was set at 555 feet 5-1/2 inches from the foundation and<br>
the work declared finished. The foundation is 146-1/2 feet square;<br>
number of stones used above the 130-foot level, 19,163; total weight<br>
stone used in work, 81,120 tons.<br>
<br>
The largest State in our grand republic is Texas, which contains 274,350<br>
square miles, capable of sustaining 20,000,000 people, and then it would<br>
not be more crowded than Scotland is at present. It has been estimated<br>
that the entire population of the globe could be seated upon chairs<br>
within the boundary of Texas and each have four feet of elbow room.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi River, from the source of the Missouri to the Eads<br>
jetties, is the longest river in the world. It is 4,300 miles in length<br>
and drains an area of 1,726,000 square miles. The Amazon, which is<br>
without doubt the widest river in the world, including the Beni, is<br>
4,000 miles in length and drains 2,330,000 square miles of territory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SINGLE TAX.</span><br>
<br>
This idea was first formulated by Mr. Henry George in 1879, and has<br>
grown steadily in favor. Single-tax men assert as a fundamental<br>
principle that all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth;<br>
therefore, no one should be allowed to hold valuable land without paying<br>
to the community the value of the privilege. They hold that this is the<br>
only rightful source of public revenue, and they would therefore abolish<br>
all taxation--local, state and national--except a tax upon the rental<br>
value of land exclusive of its improvements, the revenue thus raised to<br>
be divided among local, state and general governments, as the revenue<br>
from certain direct taxes is now divided between local and state<br>
governments.<br>
<br>
The single tax would not fall on all land, but only on valuable land,<br>
and on that in proportion to its value. It would thus be a tax, not on<br>
use or improvements, but on ownership of land, taking what would<br>
otherwise go to the landlord as owner.<br>
<br>
In accordance with the principle that all men are equally entitled to<br>
the use of the earth, they would solve the transportation problem by<br>
public ownership and control of all highways, including the roadbeds of<br>
railroads, leaving their use equally free to all.<br>
<br>
The single-tax system would, they claim, dispense with a horde of<br>
tax-gatherers, simplify government, and greatly reduce its cost; give us<br>
with all the world that absolute free trade which now exists between the<br>
States of the Union: abolish all taxes on private issues of money; take<br>
the weight of taxation from agricultural districts, where land has<br>
little or no value apart from improvements, and put it upon valuable<br>
land, such as city lots and mineral deposits. It would call upon men to<br>
contribute for public expenses in proportion to the natural<br>
opportunities they monopolize, and make it unprofitable for speculators<br>
to hold land unused or only partly used, thus opening to labor unlimited<br>
fields of employment, solving the labor problem and abolishing<br>
involuntary poverty.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MYSTERIES OF HYPNOTISM.</span><br>
<br>
A Compend of the General Claims Made by Professional Hypnotists.<br>
<br>
Animal magnetism is the nerve-force of all human and animal bodies, and<br>
is common to every person in a greater or less degree. It may be<br>
transmitted from one person to another. The transmitting force is the<br>
concentrated effort of will-power, which sends the magnetic current<br>
through the nerves of the operator to the different parts of the body of<br>
his subject. It may be transmitted by and through the eyes, as well as<br>
the finger tips, and the application of the whole open hands, to<br>
different regions of the body of the subject, as well as to the mind.<br>
The effect of this force upon the subject will depend very much upon the<br>
health, mental capacity and general character of the operator. Its<br>
action in general should be soothing and quieting upon the nervous<br>
system; stimulating to the circulation of the blood, the brain and other<br>
vital organs of the body of the subject. It is the use and application<br>
of this power or force that constitutes hypnotism.<br>
<br>
Magnetism is a quality that inheres in every human being, and it may be<br>
cultivated like any other physical or mental force of which men and<br>
women are constituted. From the intelligent operator using it to<br>
overcome disease, a patient experiences a soothing influence that causes<br>
a relaxation of the muscles, followed by a pleasant, drowsy feeling<br>
which soon terminates in refreshing sleep. On waking, the patient feels<br>
rested; all his troubles have vanished from consciousness and he is as<br>
if he had a new lease of life.<br>
<br>
In the true hypnotic condition, when a patient voluntarily submits to<br>
the operator, any attempt to make suggestions against the interests of<br>
the patient can invariably be frustrated by the patient.<br>
Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and some of the best known<br>
operators who have recorded their experiments assert that suggestions<br>
not in accord with the best interest of the patient could not be carried<br>
out. No one was ever induced to commit any crime under hypnosis, that<br>
could not have been induced to do the same thing much easier without<br>
hypnosis.<br>
<br>
The hypnotic state is a condition of mind that extends from a<br>
comparatively wakeful state, with slight drowsiness, to complete<br>
somnambulism, no two subjects, as a rule, ever presenting the same<br>
characteristics.<br>
<br>
The operator, to be successful, must have control of his own mind, be in<br>
perfect health and have the ability to keep his mind concentrated upon<br>
the object he desires to accomplish with his subject.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO CARE FOR A PIANO.</span><br>
By William H. Damon<br>
<br>
The most important thing in the preservation of a piano is to avoid<br>
atmospheric changes and extremes and sudden changes of temperature.<br>
Where the summer condition of the atmosphere is damp all precautions<br>
possible should be taken to avoid an entirely dry condition in winter,<br>
such as that given by steam or furnace heat. In all cases should the air<br>
in the home contain moisture enough to permit a heavy frost on the<br>
windows in zero weather. The absence of frost under such conditions is<br>
positive proof of an entirely dry atmosphere, and this is a piano's most<br>
dangerous enemy, causing the sounding board to crack, shrinking up the<br>
bridges, and consequently putting the piano seriously out of tune, also<br>
causing an undue dryness in all the action parts and often a loosening<br>
of the glue joints, thus producing clicks and rattles. To obviate this<br>
difficulty is by no means an easy task and will require considerable<br>
attention. Permit all the fresh air possible during winter, being<br>
careful to keep the piano out of cold drafts, as this will cause a<br>
sudden contraction of the varnish and cause it to check or crack. Plants<br>
in the room are desirable and vessels of water of any kind will be of<br>
assistance. The most potent means of avoiding extreme dryness is to<br>
place a single-loaf bread-pan half full of water in the lower part of<br>
the piano, taking out the lower panel and placing it on either side of<br>
the pedals inside. This should be refilled about once a month during<br>
artificial heat, care being taken to remove the vessel as soon as the<br>
heat is discontinued in the spring. In cases where stove heat is used<br>
these precautions are not necessary.<br>
<br>
The action of a piano, like any other delicate piece of machinery,<br>
should be carefully examined, and, if necessary, adjusted each time it<br>
is tuned. The hammers need occasional and careful attention to preserve<br>
original tone quality and elasticity. Never allow the piano to be beaten<br>
or played hard upon. This is ruinous to both the action and tuning. When<br>
not in use the music rack and top should be closed to exclude dust. The<br>
keyboard need never be closed, as the ivory needs both light and<br>
ventilation and will eventually turn yellow unless left open.<br>
<br>
The case demands careful treatment to preserve its beauty and polish,<br>
Never use anything other than a soft piece of cotton cloth or cheese<br>
cloth to dust it with. Never wipe it with a dry chamois skin or silk<br>
cloth. Silk is not as soft as cotton and will scratch. A dry chamois<br>
skin picks up the dust and grit and gradually scours off the fine<br>
finish. In dusting never use a feather duster, nor rub the piano hard<br>
with anything. The dust should be whipped off, and not rubbed into the<br>
varnish. If the piano is dingy, smoky or dirty looking, it should be<br>
washed carefully with lukewarm water with a little ammonia in it to<br>
soften it. Never use soap. Use nothing but a small, soft sponge and a<br>
chamois skin. Wipe over a small part at a time with the sponge,<br>
following quickly with the wet chamois skin wrung out of the same water.<br>
This will dry it immediately and leave it as beautiful and clean as new.<br>
Never use patent polishes. If your piano needs polishing employ a<br>
competent polisher to give it a hand-rubbing friction polish.<br>
<br>

The highest mountain on the globe is not, as is generally supposed, Mt.<br>
Everest, that honor belonging to a lofty peak named Mt. Hercules on the<br>
Isle of Papua, New Guinea, discovered by Capt. Lawson in 1881, According<br>
to Lawson, this monster is 32,763 feet in height, being 3,781 feet<br>
higher than Mt. Everest, which is only 29,002 feet above the level of<br>
the Indian Ocean.<br>
<br>
[Transcriber's Note: The highest point in New Guinea is Puncak Jaya<br>
(Mount Carstensz or the Carstensz Pyramid), at 16,023 feet.]<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SALT-RISING BREAD.</span><br>
<br>
The real formula for making salt-rising bread, as set down by the<br>
daughter of Governor Stubbs, of Kansas, and by him communicated to<br>
Theodore Roosevelt, is as follows, according to the "Saturday Evening<br>
Post":<br>
<br>
"On the night before you contemplate this masterpiece of baking take<br>
half a cupful of corn meal and a pinch each of salt and sugar. Scald<br>
this with new milk heated to the boiling point and mix to the thickness<br>
of mush. This can be made in a cup. Wrap in a clean cloth and put in a<br>
warm place overnight.<br>
<br>
"In the morning, when all is ready, take a one-gallon stone jar and into<br>
this put one scant cupful of new milk. Add a level teaspoonful of salt<br>
and one of sugar. Scald this with three cupfuls of water heated to the<br>
boiling point. Reduce to a temperature of one hundred and eight degrees<br>
with cold water, using a milk thermometer to enable you to get exactly<br>
the right temperature. Then add flour and mix to a good batter; after<br>
the batter is made, mix in your starter that was made the night before.<br>
Cover the stone jar with a plate and put the jar in a large kettle of<br>
water and keep this water at a temperature of one hundred and eight<br>
degrees until the sponge rises. It should rise at least an inch and a<br>
half. When it has raised mix to a stiff dough, make into loaves and put<br>
into pans. Do not let the heat get out of the dough while working.<br>
Grease the loaves well on top and set your bread where it will be warm<br>
and rise. After the loaves rise bake in a medium oven for one hour and<br>
ten minutes. When you take the loaves from the oven wrap them in a<br>
bread-cloth."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A CURE FOR LOVE.</span><br>
<br>
Take twelve ounces of dislike, one pound of resolution, two grains of<br>
common sense, two ounces of experience, a large sprig of time, and three<br>
quarts of cooling water of consideration. Set them over a gentle fire of<br>
love, sweeten it with sugar of forgetfulness, skim it with the spoon of<br>
melancholy, put it in the bottom of your heart, cork it with the cork of<br>
clean conscience. Let it remain and you will quickly find ease and be<br>
restored to your senses again.<br>
<br>
These things can be had of the apothecary at the house of Understanding<br>
next door to Reason, on Prudent street.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DOING BUSINESS WITH A BANK</span><br>
<br>
In opening your account with a bank it is proper that you should first<br>
be introduced to the cashier, or some other official. If you are engaged<br>
in business, that officer will inquire as to your particular business or<br>
calling, your address, etc., and unless he is already satisfied on this<br>
point, he may make inquiries as to your business standing. This being<br>
satisfactory, he will hand you a passbook, and some deposit tickets,<br>
whereupon you make your first deposit, entering the amount on the<br>
ticket. You will then be asked to write your signature in a book<br>
provided for that purpose, or upon a card to be filed away for<br>
reference.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Signature.<br>
<br>
This signature should be just as you intend to use it in all your<br>
dealings with the bank. If, for instance, your name is John Henry Smith,<br>
you may write it J. H. Smith, J. Henry Smith. John H. Smith or John<br>
Henry Smith, but whatever form you adopt should be used all the time.<br>
Once having adopted the form, it should be maintained in exactly that<br>
way. The only excuse for variation from your usual signature is when<br>
presenting checks or other paper made payable to you. In that case,<br>
supposing you had adopted the form J. Henry Smith for your regular<br>
signature, and the check is made payable to John H. Smith, you should<br>
first write on the back of that check "John H. Smith," and immediately<br>
under this you should place your regular signature.<br>
<br>
<br>
Depositing Money.<br>
<br>
When making a deposit, always use the deposit ticket provided by the<br>
bank, filling it out yourself in ink. From this ticket, which is first<br>
checked up by the receiving teller, the amount of your deposit is placed<br>
to your credit. Do not ask the teller to fill our your deposit ticket.<br>
No doubt he would be glad to accommodate you, but to do so would violate<br>
a rule which protects both the bank and the depositor, Deposit tickets<br>
are preserved by the bank, and often serve to correct mistakes.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to Avoid Mistakes.<br>
<br>
Consider for a moment the vast aggregate of bank transactions, and you<br>
will see that perfect system on the part of the banks and bank officials<br>
is required to insure accuracy and avoid mistakes. Sometimes the<br>
requirements of the banks may seem arbitrary and troublesome, but<br>
reflection will show that they safeguard the depositor as well as the<br>
bank. The simple rules here laid down will enable anyone who has<br>
business with a bank to do so with the least trouble and with absolute<br>
safety.<br>
<br>
<br>
How to Make Out a Check.<br>
<br>
Checks are the most satisfactory and most convenient method of paying a<br>
debt or making any ordinary remittance. The stub of your check book will<br>
furnish a permanent memorandum, and when the check is canceled and<br>
returned to you by the bank, it is an indisputable evidence that the<br>
debt has been paid, or that the remittance has been made. The making of<br>
a check is a simple matter, but even the best business men make mistakes<br>
sometimes which are as difficult to remedy as they are easy to avoid.<br>
The hints here given and the facsimiles of checks printed in<br>
illustration will repay careful study.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 846px; height: 362px;" alt="" src="images/054Pic.jpg"><br>
A Check Properly Drawn. The name and amount are against<br>
the left side of their fields.<br>
<br>
<br>
The first facsimile shows a check properly made. It will be seen, in the<br>
first place, that this check is written very plainly, and that there is<br>
no room for the insertion of extra figures or words. The writing of the<br>
amount commences as nearly as possible to the extreme left of the check.<br>
The figures are written close together and there is no space between the<br>
first figure and the dollar mark.<br>
<br>
All erasures in checks should be avoided. If you have made a mistake,<br>
tear a blank check from the back of your check book and use that in<br>
place of the one spoiled.<br>
<br>
Some business men allow their clerks to fill out checks on the<br>
typewriter. This is ill-advised for two reasons: First, it is much<br>
easier to alter a typewritten check than one filled in with a pen; in<br>
the second place, a teller, in passing on the genuineness of a check,<br>
takes into consideration the character of the handwriting in the body of<br>
the check as well as in the signature. The typewritten characters offer<br>
no clue to individuality.<br>
<br>
Never mail a check drawn to "Bearer." Remember that if your check is<br>
made payable to "Bearer" or to "John Smith or Bearer" it may be cashed<br>
by anybody who happens to have it. Unless it is for a large amount the<br>
paying teller of your bank will look only to see whether your signature<br>
is correct, and, that being right, the bank cannot be held responsible<br>
if the check should have come into the wrong hands.<br>
<br>
A check drawn to order can be cashed only when the person to whose order<br>
it has been drawn has indorsed it by writing his or her name on the back<br>
and the bank will be responsible for the correctness of the indorsement.<br>
<br>
If you make your check payable say, to William Armstrong or order,<br>
nobody but William Armstrong, or some one to whom he indorses the check,<br>
can collect the amount, and if through fraud or otherwise some one not<br>
entitled to it gets the money which the check calls for, the<br>
responsibility is not yours, but the bank's. It is for that reason that<br>
bankers and business men use such great care in accepting checks.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 846px; height: 346px;" alt="" src="images/056Pic.jpg"><br>
A
Check Carelessly Drawn. The text and numbers for the<br>
amount is in the center of their fields, leaving of space for extra<br>
text.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 847px; height: 337px;" alt="" src="images/057Pic.jpg"><br>
The Same Check "Raised". The amount has been changed from<br>
One Hundred/100.00 to Eighty-One Hundred/$8100.00.<br>
<br>
<br>
For the same reason you should never accept a check from anybody whom<br>
you do not know as responsible, and you should not be surprised or<br>
angered if some one else should hesitate to take a check from you.<br>
<br>
Checks or drafts received by you should be deposited as soon as<br>
possible. Should you receive a check for a considerable amount and have<br>
no convenient bank account, you should go to the bank on which the check<br>
is drawn and have the cashier certify it by stamping "Accepted" or<br>
"Certified" across the face over his signature. That formality makes the<br>
paper as good as money so long as the bank accepting it is solvent.<br>
<br>
It sometimes happens that a check drawn in good faith by a responsible<br>
party is withheld so long by the person receiving it that there is no<br>
money to the account when the check is finally presented.<br>
<br>
<br>
Paying Notes and Acceptances.<br>
<br>
Make your notes and accepted drafts payable at the bank where you do<br>
business. Whether it or other banks hold them for collection, they will<br>
be presented to your bank when due.<br>
<br>
Pay your notes, etc., on the day they fall due, and early in the day if<br>
convenient, or leave a check for the amount with your bank on the day<br>
before your paper matures. Banks will not pay notes or drafts without<br>
instructions.<br>
<br>
Keep a careful record of the days of maturity of all your paper. Banks<br>
usually notify all payers a few days beforehand when their paper<br>
matures, but this is only courtesy on their part and not an obligation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exchange.<br>
<br>
"Exchange" means funds in other cities made available by bankers' drafts<br>
on such places. These drafts afford the safest and cheapest means for<br>
remitting money. Drafts on New York are worth their face value<br>
practically all over the United States in settlement of accounts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Collections.<br>
<br>
A draft is sometimes the most convenient form for collecting an account.<br>
The prevalence of the custom is due to the fact that most men will wait<br>
to be asked to pay a debt. If a draft is a time draft it is accepted by<br>
the person on whom it is drawn by writing his name and date across the<br>
face. This makes it practically a note, to be paid at maturity.<br>
<br>
Notes or drafts that you desire to have collected for you by your bank<br>
should be left at the bank several days before they are due, so as to<br>
give ample time to notify the payers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Borrowing.<br>
<br>
Banks are always willing to loan their funds to responsible persons<br>
within reasonable limits. That is what they exist for. There is, of<br>
course, a limit to the amount a bank may loan, even on the best known<br>
security, but the customer of the bank is entitled to and will receive<br>
the first consideration.<br>
<br>
The customer should not hesitate, when occasion requires, to offer to<br>
the bank for discount such paper as may come into his hands in the<br>
course of business, if, in his opinion, the paper is good. At the same<br>
time he should not be offended if his bank refuses to take it even<br>
without giving reasons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Indorsing Checks, Etc.<br>
<br>
When depositing checks, drafts, etc., see that they are dated properly<br>
and that the written amounts and figures correspond. The proper way to<br>
indorse a check or draft--this also applies to notes and other<br>
negotiable paper--is to write your name upon the back about one inch<br>
from the top. The proper end may be determined in this way: As you read<br>
the check, holding one end in each hand, draw the right hand toward you,<br>
and turn the check over. The end which is then farthest from you is the<br>
top. If, however, the check, draft or note has already been indorsed by<br>
another person, you should write your name directly under the other<br>
indorsement, even if that is on the wrong end. If your own name on the<br>
face of the check, draft or note is misspelled, or has the wrong<br>
initials, but if the paper is clearly intended for you, you should first<br>
write your name as it appears on the face, and under it your regular<br>
signature. You should indorse every check you deposit, even though it be<br>
payable to bearer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mistakes in Banking.<br>
<br>
Mr. Samuel Woods, a member of the American Institute of Bank Clerks,<br>
recently contributed to Munsey's Magazine an interesting article on the<br>
subject of "Mistakes in Banking." From this we are permitted by the<br>
courtesy of the publishers of Munsey's to reproduce two of the<br>
facsimiles shown.<br>
<br>
One wrong word, or figure, or letter--the right thing in the wrong way<br>
or the wrong place--the scratch of an eraser or the alteration of a<br>
word--or any one of these things, in the making or cashing of a check,<br>
is liable to become as expensive as a racing automobile.<br>
<br>
The paying teller of a bank, says Mr. Woods, must keep his eyes open for<br>
new dangers as well as old ones. The cleverest crooks in the country are<br>
pitting their brains against his. After he has learned the proper guard<br>
for all the well-known tricks and forgeries it is still possible that an<br>
entirely new combination may leave him minus cash and plus experience.<br>
<br>
But it is not the unique and novel swindle that is most dangerous,<br>
either to a bank or an individual. It is the simple, ordinary mistake or<br>
the time-worn trick that makes continuous trouble. Apparently, every new<br>
generation contains a number of dishonest people who lay the same traps,<br>
and a number of careless people who fall into these traps in the same<br>
old way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Check-Raising Made Easy.<br>
<br>
One of the first lessons, for instance, that a depositor should learn<br>
before he is qualified to own a check-book is to commence writing the<br>
amount as near as possible to the extreme left of the check. Those who<br>
forget this are often reminded of it in a costly way. Some one "raises"<br>
their checks by writing another figure in front of the proper amount.<br>
"Five hundred" might be "raised" to "twenty-five hundred" in this way,<br>
even by an unskilled forger.<br>
<br>
The highest court has recently decided that a bank cannot be held<br>
responsible, when it pays a "raised" check, if the maker of the check<br>
failed in the first place to write it out correctly. The treasurer of<br>
the Bath Electric Company, of Bath, Maine, had written a check for one<br>
hundred dollars, which was raised to eighty-one hundred dollars and<br>
cashed. The court held that the company, and not the bank, should lose<br>
the eight thousand dollars, because of the "gross carelessness" in<br>
drawing up the check. Facsimiles showing the check as originally written<br>
and as it looked when paid are here reproduced.<br>
<br>
<br>
Altered Words and Figures.<br>
<br>
The altered check is the bane of the paying teller's profession, and it<br>
is the general practice in conservative banks to accept no checks or<br>
other paper which shows signs of erasure or alteration in either words<br>
or figures.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THEOSOPHY.</span><br>
<br>
Much is said nowadays about theosophy, which is really but another name<br>
for mysticism. It is not a philosophy, for it will have nothing to do<br>
with philosophical methods; it might be called a religion, though it has<br>
never had a following large enough to make a very strong impression on<br>
the world's religious history. The name is from the Greek word<br>
theosophia--divine wisdom--and the object of theosophical study is<br>
professedly to understand the nature of divine things. It differs,<br>
however, from both philosophy and theology even when these have the same<br>
object of investigation. For, in seeking to learn the divine nature and<br>
attributes, philosophy employs the methods and principles of natural<br>
reasoning; theology uses these, adding to them certain principles<br>
derived from revelation. Theosophy, on the other hand, professes to<br>
exclude all reasoning processes as imperfect, and to derive its<br>
knowledge from direct communication with God himself. It does not,<br>
therefore, accept the truths of recorded revelation as immutable, but as<br>
subject to modification by later and personal revelations. The<br>
theosophical idea has had followers from the earliest times. Since the<br>
Christian era we may class among theosophists such sects as<br>
Neo-Platonists, the Hesychasts of the Greek Church, the Mystics of<br>
mediaeval times, and, in later times, the disciples of Paracelsus,<br>
Thalhauser, Bohme, Swedenborg and others. Recently a small sect has<br>
arisen, which has taken the name of Theosophists. Its leader was an<br>
English gentleman who had become fascinated with the doctrine of<br>
Buddhism. Taking a few of his followers to India, they have been<br>
prosecuting their studies there, certain individuals attracting<br>
considerable attention by a claim to miraculous powers. It need hardly<br>
be said that the revelations they have claimed to receive have been,<br>
thus far, without element of benefit to the human race.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE EVOLUTION THEORY.</span><br>
<br>
The evolution or development theory declares the universe as it now<br>
exists to be the result of a long series of changes which were so far<br>
related to each other as to form a series of growths analogous to the<br>
evolving of the parts of a growing organism. Herbert Spencer defines<br>
evolution as a progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, from<br>
general to special, from the simple to the complex elements of life, and<br>
it is believed that this process can be traced in the formation of<br>
worlds in space, in the multiplication of types and species among<br>
animals and plants, in the origin and changes of languages and<br>
literature and the arts, and also in all the changes of human<br>
institutions and society. Asserting the general fact of progress in<br>
nature, the evolution theory shows that the method of this progress has<br>
been (1) by the multiplication of organs and functions; (2) according to<br>
a defined unity of plan, although with (3) intervention of transitional<br>
forms, and (4) with modifications dependent upon surrounding conditions.<br>
Ancient writers occasionally seemed to have a glimmering knowledge of<br>
the fact of progress in nature, but as a theory "evolution" belongs to<br>
the enlightenment of the nineteenth century. Leibnitz, in the latter<br>
part of the seventeenth century first uttered the opinion that the earth<br>
was once in a fluid condition and Kant about the middle of the<br>
eighteenth century, definitely propounded the nebular hypothesis, which<br>
was enlarged as a theory by the Herschels. The first writer to suggest<br>
the transmutation of species among animals was Buffon, about 1750, and<br>
other writers followed out the idea. The eccentric Lord Monboddo was the<br>
first to suggest the possible descent of man from the ape, about 1774.<br>
In 1813 Dr. W. C. Wells first proposed to apply the principle of natural<br>
selection to the natural history of man, and in 1822 Professor Herbert<br>
first asserted the probable transmutation of species of plants. In 1844<br>
a book appeared called "Vestiges of Creation," which, though evidently<br>
not written by a scientific student, yet attracted great attention by<br>
its bold and ingenious theories. The authorship of this book was never<br>
revealed until after the death of Robert Chambers, a few years since, it<br>
became known that this publisher, whom no one would ever have suspected<br>
of holding such heterodox theories, had actually written it. But the two<br>
great apostles of the evolution theory were Charles Darwin and Herbert<br>
Spencer. The latter began his great work, the "First Principles of<br>
Philosophy," showing the application of evolution in the facts of life,<br>
in 1852. In 1859 appeared Darwin's "Origin of Species." The hypothesis<br>
of the latter was that different species originated in spontaneous<br>
variation, and the survival of the fittest through natural selection and<br>
the struggle for existence. This theory was further elaborated and<br>
applied by Spencer, Darwin, Huxley, and other writers in Europe and<br>
America, and though to-day by no means all the ideas upheld by these<br>
early advocates of the theory are still accepted, evolution as a<br>
principle is now acknowledged by nearly all scientists. It is taken to<br>
be an established fact in nature, a valid induction from man's knowledge<br>
of natural order.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ENGLISH SPARROW.</span><br>
<br>
The first English sparrow was brought to the United States in 1850, but<br>
it was not until 1870 that the species can be said to have firmly<br>
established itself. Since then it has taken possession of the country.<br>
Its fecundity is amazing. In the latitude of New York and southward it<br>
hatches, as a rule, five or six broods in a season, with from four to<br>
six young in a brood. Assuming the average annual product of a pair to<br>
be twenty-four young, of which half are females and half males, and<br>
assuming further, for the sake of computation, that all live, together<br>
with their offspring, it will be seen that in ten years the progeny of a<br>
single pair would be 275,716,983,698.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">FEMININE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT.</span><br>
<br>
It is often asked how stout a woman ought to be in proportion to her<br>
height. A very young girl may becomingly be thinner than a matron, but<br>
the following table gives a fair indication of proper proportions:<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEN A MAN BECOMES OF AGE.</span><br>
<br>
The question sometimes arises whether it man is entitled to vote at an<br>
election held on the day preceding the twenty-first anniversary of his<br>
birth. Blackstone, in his Commentaries, book 1, page 463, says: "Full<br>
age in male or female is 21 years, which age is completed on the day<br>
preceding the anniversary of a person's birth, who, till that time, is<br>
an infant, and so styled in law." The late Chief Justice Sharswood, in<br>
his edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, quotes Christian's note on the<br>
above as follows: "If he is born on the 16th day of February, 1608, he<br>
is of age to do any legal act on the morning of the 15th of February,<br>
1629, though he may not have lived twenty-one years by nearly<br>
forty-eight hours. The reason assigned is that in law there is no<br>
fraction of a day; and if the birth were on the last second of one day<br>
and the act on the first second of the preceding day twenty-one years<br>
after, then twenty-one years would be complete, and in the law it is the<br>
same whether a thing is done upon one moment of the day or another."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DREAMS AND THEIR MEANING</span><br>
<br>
The Bible speaks of dreams as being sometimes prophetic, or suggestive<br>
of future events.<br>
<br>
This belief has prevailed in all ages and countries, and there are<br>
numerous modern examples, apparently authenticated, which would appear<br>
to favor this hypothesis.<br>
<br>
The interpretation of dreams was a part of the business of the<br>
soothsayers at the royal courts of Egypt, Babylon and other ancient<br>
nations.<br>
<br>
Dreams and visions have attracted the attention of mankind of every age<br>
and nation. It has been claimed by all nations, both enlightened and<br>
heathen, that dreams are spiritual revelations to men; so much so, that<br>
their modes of worship have been founded upon the interpretation of<br>
dreams and visions. Why should we discard the interpretation of dreams<br>
while our mode of worship, faith and knowledge of Deity are founded upon<br>
the interpretation of the dreams and visions of the prophets and seers<br>
of old.<br>
<br>
Dreams vividly impressed upon the mind are sure to be followed by some<br>
event.<br>
<br>
We read in the Holy Scripture the revelation of the Deity to His chosen<br>
people, through the prophet Joel: "And it shall come to pass, afterward,<br>
that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your<br>
daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young<br>
men shall see visions, and also upon the servants and the handmaids in<br>
those days will I pour out My Spirit." (Joel ii, 28.)<br>
<br>
Both sacred and profane history contain so many examples of the<br>
fulfilment of dreams that he who has no faith in them must be very<br>
skeptical indeed.<br>
<br>
Hippocrates says that when the body is asleep the soul is awake, and<br>
transports itself everywhere the body would be able to go; knows and<br>
sees all that the body could see or know were it awake; that it touches<br>
all that the body could touch. In a word, it performs all the actions<br>
that the body of a sleeping man could do were he awake.<br>
<br>
A dream, to have a significance, must occur to the sleeper while in<br>
healthy and tranquil sleep. Those dreams of which we have not a vivid<br>
conception, or clear remembrance, have no significance.<br>
<br>
Those of which we have a clear remembrance must have formed in the mind<br>
in the latter part of the night, for up to that time the faculties of<br>
the body have been employed in digesting the events of the day.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS.</span><br>
<br>
Flowers may be combined and arranged so as to express even the nicest<br>
shades of sentiment.<br>
<br>
If a flower is offered reversed, its direct significance is likewise<br>
reversed, so that the flower now means its opposite.<br>
<br>
A rosebud divested of its thorns, but retaining its leaves conveys the<br>
sentiment. "I fear no longer; I hope." Stripped of leaves and thorns, it<br>
signifies, "There is nothing to hope or fear."<br>
<br>
A full-blown rose placed over two buds signifies "Secrecy."<br>
<br>
"Yes" is implied by touching the flower given to the lips.<br>
<br>
"No" by pinching off a petal and casting it away.<br>
<br>
"I am," is expressed by a laurel leaf twined around the bouquet. "I<br>
have," by an ivy leaf folded together. "I offer you," by a leaf of<br>
Virginia creeper.<br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT DIFFERENT EYES INDICATE.</span><br>
<br>
The long, almond-shaped eye with thick eyelids covering nearly half of<br>
the pupil, when taken in connection with the full brow, is indicative of<br>
genius, and is often found in artists, literary and scientific men. It<br>
is the eye of talent, or impressibility. The large, open, transparent<br>
eye, of whatever color, is indicative of elegance, of taste, of<br>
refinement, of wit, of intelligence. Weakly marked eyebrows indicate a<br>
feeble constitution and a tendency to melancholia, Deep sunken eyes are<br>
selfish, while eyes in which the whole iris shows indicate erraticism,<br>
if not lunacy. Round eyes are indicative of innocence; strongly<br>
protuberant eyes of weakness of both mind and body. Eyes small and close<br>
together typify cunning, while those far apart and open indicate<br>
frankness. The normal distance between the eyes is the width of one eye;<br>
a distance greater or less than this intensifies the character supposed<br>
to be symbolized. Sharp angles, turning down at the corners of the eyes,<br>
are seen in persons of acute judgment and penetration. Well-opened<br>
steady eyes belong to the sincere; wide staring eyes to the impertinent.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MYSTERIES OF PALMISTRY</span><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 381px; height: 561px;" alt="" src="images/090Pic.jpg"><br>
<br>
The following points, upon which the Science of Palmistry is based,<br>
explain its mysteries, and will be found very interesting, amusing and<br>
instructive:<br>
<br>
<br>
Form of the Hand.<br>
<br>
Hands are classed into seven types, each of which is illustrated by the<br>
cuts on the preceding page, and described as follows:<br>
<br>
Plate I--The Elementary or Bilious Hand, indicating brutal instinct<br>
instead of reason as the governing power of the character.<br>
<br>
Plate II--The Square or Jupiter Hand, indicating a practical, stubborn,<br>
methodical, and conventional character; one apt to be suspicious of<br>
strangers and radical in views.<br>
<br>
Plate III--The Spatulate or Nervous Hand, so named because of its<br>
imagined resemblance to a spatula. It is broad at the base of the<br>
fingers, and indicates great energy and push to discover; also, courage<br>
and fearlessness.<br>
<br>
Plate IV--The Philosophic or Venus Hand, has a long, thin, muscular<br>
palm, with long, knotty fingers; indicates a student of nature and<br>
searcher after truth.<br>
<br>
Plate V--The Mercury or Artistic Hand, indicates quick temper,<br>
impulsiveness; a character that is light-hearted, gay and charitable,<br>
to-day; and to-morrow, sad, tearful and uncharitable.<br>
<br>
Plate VI--The Lunar or Idealistic Hand, indicates an extremely sensitive<br>
nature.<br>
<br>
Plate VII--The Harmonic or Solar Hand, indicates a character of great<br>
versatility, brilliant in conversation, and an adept in diplomacy.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Fingers.<br>
<br>
For fortune-telling the fingers from first to fourth are designated as<br>
Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo and Mercury.<br>
<br>
Note the cut on preceding page, representing the different types of<br>
fingers, numbered from one to eleven.<br>
<br>
1--Large fingers indicate a person of vulgar tastes and a cruel, selfish<br>
disposition.<br>
<br>
2--Small, thin fingers indicate a keen, quick acting mind and a person<br>
not very particular about personal appearance.<br>
<br>
3--Long, lean fingers indicate an inquiring disposition; love of details<br>
in narrative; short fingers imply simple tastes and selfishness.<br>
<br>
4--Fat fingers, largely developed at base, indicate sensualness; if<br>
small at base, the reverse.<br>
<br>
5--Smooth fingers indicate artistic ability.<br>
<br>
6--Knotty fingers indicate truthfulness and good order in business<br>
affairs.<br>
<br>
7--Pointed fingers indicate a very magnetic and enthusiastic<br>
personality.<br>
<br>
8--Square fingers indicate a strong mind, regularity and love of good<br>
order.<br>
<br>
9--Spatulate fingers indicate a character of positiveness in opinions<br>
and lacking in gentleness.<br>
<br>
10--Fingers of mixed shape indicate a harmonious disposition, with<br>
ability to easily adapt oneself to all conditions.<br>
<br>
11--Obtuse fingers indicate coarse and cruel sensibilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Phalanges of the Fingers.<br>
<br>
See plate VIII, 1, 2, 3--The Phalanges of the Thumb: 4, 5, 6--Repeated<br>
on each finger, indicate the phalanges of the four fingers.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Mounts of the Hands.<br>
<br>
See plate IX--A, Mount Venus; B, Mount Jupiter; C, Mount Saturn; D,<br>
Mount Apollo; E. Mount Mercury; F, Mount Luna; G, Mount Mars.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Shape and Length of the Phalanges<br>
represent certain qualities and features of character, as presented in<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
Jupiter, the first finger; if the first phalange is longer than the<br>
second, it indicates ability to control others, direct and maintain<br>
order; if the second phalange is long and well developed, it indicates<br>
leadership; if short and thin, intellectual weakness; if the third<br>
phalange is long, it indicates love of power in material things.<br>
<br>
Saturn, second finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second,<br>
it indicates ability for mastering scientific subjects; if the second<br>
phalange is long, it indicates great interest in subjects requiring deep<br>
study; if the third phalange is long, it indicates a love of metaphysics<br>
and money.<br>
<br>
Apollo, third finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second,<br>
it indicates love of the arts; if the second phalange is long, it<br>
indicates success and love of riches; if the third phalange is thick, it<br>
indicates an inherited talent of the arts.<br>
<br>
Mercury, fourth finger; if the first phalange is longer than the second,<br>
it indicates a taste for and love of research; if the second phalange is<br>
long and well developed, it indicates industrious habits; if the third<br>
phalange is long and fat, it indicates a desire for the comforts of<br>
life.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Mountains.<br>
<br>
These are points or elevations on the palm.<br>
<br>
Mount Venus, if prominent, indicates a person of strong passions, great<br>
energy in business, and admiration of physical beauty in the opposite<br>
sex; it also indicates love of children, home and wife, or husband. When<br>
not well developed there is a lack of love for home, children, wife or<br>
husband; and in a man, it indicates egotism and laziness,--in a woman,<br>
hysteria.<br>
<br>
Mount Jupiter, if prominent, indicates a person who is generous, loves<br>
power, and is brilliant in conversation; if a woman, she desires to<br>
shine and be a social leader. When not well developed, it indicates lack<br>
of self-esteem, slovenliness and indifference to personal appearance.<br>
<br>
Mount Saturn, if prominent, indicates a serious-minded person,<br>
religiously inclined, slow to reach a conclusion, very prudent, free in<br>
the expression of opinions, but inclined to be pessimistic.<br>
<br>
Mount Apollo, if prominent, indicates ability as an artist, generosity,<br>
courageousness, and a poetical nature, apt to be a spendthrift. When not<br>
well developed, it indicates cautiousness and prudence.<br>
<br>
Mount Mercury, if prominent, indicates keen perceptions, cleverness in<br>
conversation, a talent for the sciences, industry, and deceitfulness. If<br>
not well developed, it indicates a phlegmatic, stupid disposition.<br>
<br>
Mount Luna, if prominent, indicates a dreamy, changeable, capricious,<br>
enthusiastic, and inventive nature. When not well developed, it<br>
indicates constancy, love of home, and ability to imitate others.<br>
<br>
Mount Mars, if prominent, indicates self-respect, coolness, and control<br>
of self under trying circumstances, courage, venturesomeness and<br>
confidence in one's ability for anything undertaken. When not well<br>
developed, it indicates the opposite of these characteristics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lines On the Hand.<br>
<br>
If the lines of the hand are not well defined, this fact indicates poor<br>
health.<br>
<br>
Deep red lines indicate good, robust health. Yellow lines indicate<br>
excessive biliousness.<br>
<br>
Dark-colored lines indicate a melancholy and reserved disposition.<br>
<br>
The Life Line extends from the outer base of Mount Jupiter, entirely<br>
around the base of Mount Venus. If chained under Jupiter, it indicates<br>
bad health in early life. Hair lines extending from it imply weakness,<br>
and if cut by small lines from Mount Venus, misplaced affections and<br>
domestic broils. If arising from Mount Jupiter, an ambition to be<br>
wealthy and learned. If it is joined by the Line of the Head at its<br>
beginning, prudence and wisdom are indicated. If it joins Heart and Head<br>
line's at its commencement, a great catastrophe will be experienced by<br>
the person so marked. A square on it denotes success. All lines that<br>
follow it give it strength. Lines that cut the Life Line extending<br>
through the Heart Line denote interference in a love affair. If it is<br>
crossed by small lines, illness is indicated. Short and badly drawn<br>
lines, unequal in size, imply bad blood and a tendency to fevers.<br>
<br>
The Heart Line, if it extends across the hand at the base of the finger<br>
mounts, and is deep and well defined, indicates purity and devotion; if<br>
well defined from Mount Jupiter only, a jealous and tyrannical<br>
disposition is indicated; if it begins at Mount Saturn and is without<br>
branches, it is a fatal sign; if short and well defined in the Harmonic<br>
type of hand it indicates intense affection when it is reciprocated; if<br>
short on the Mercury type of hand, it implies deep interest in<br>
intellectual pursuits; it short and deep in the Elementary type of hand,<br>
it implies the disposition to satisfy desire by brutal force, instead of<br>
by love.<br>
<br>
The Head Line is parallel to Heart Line and forms the second branch of<br>
letter M, generally very plain in most hands; if long and deep it<br>
indicates ability to care for one's self; if hair lines are attached to<br>
it, mental worry; if it divides toward Mount Mercury love affairs will<br>
be first, and business secondary; if well defined its whole length, it<br>
implies a well-balanced brain; a line from it extending into a star on<br>
Mount Jupiter, great versatility, pride and love for knowledge are<br>
indicated; if it extend to Mount Luna interest in occult studies is<br>
implied; separated from the Life Line, indicates aggressiveness; if it<br>
is broken, death is indicated from an injury in the head.<br>
<br>
The Rascettes are lines across the wrist where the palm joins it.<br>
<br>
It is claimed they indicate length of life; if straight it is a good<br>
sign. One Rascette indicates thirty years of life; two lines, sixty;<br>
three lines, ninety.<br>
<br>
The Fate Line commences at Rascettes, and if it extends straight to<br>
Mount Saturn, uninterrupted, and alike in both hands, good luck and<br>
success are realized without personal exertion. If not in one hand and<br>
interrupted in the other, success will be experienced only by great<br>
effort. If well defined at the wrist the early life is bright and<br>
promising; if broken in the center, misery for middle life is indicated.<br>
If this line touches Mounts Luna and Venus, it indicates a good<br>
disposition and wealth; if inclined toward any mount, it implies success<br>
in that line for which the mount stands. If it is made up of<br>
disconnected links, it indicates serious physical and moral struggles.<br>
Should it end at Heart Line, the life has been ruined by unrequited<br>
love. If it runs through a square, the life has been in danger and<br>
saved. Should it merge into the Heart Line and continue to Mount<br>
Jupiter, it denotes distinction and power secured through love.<br>
<br>
The Girdle of Venus is a curved line extending from Mount Jupiter to<br>
Mercury, encircling Saturn and Apollo. It appears on few hands, but it<br>
indicates superior intellect, a sensitive and capricious nature; if it<br>
extends to base of Jupiter it denotes divorce; ending in Mercury,<br>
implies great energy; should it be cut by parallel lines in a man, it<br>
indicates a hard drinker and gambler.<br>
<br>
Lines of Reputation, commencing in the middle of the hand, at the Head<br>
Line, Mount Luna or Mount Mars, indicate financial success from<br>
intellectual pursuits after years of struggling with adversity. If from<br>
Heart Line, real love of occupation and success; if from Head Line,<br>
success from selfishness. An island on this line denotes loss of<br>
character, a start on it near Apollo implies that success will be<br>
permanent, and a square, brilliant success. The absence of this line<br>
implies a struggle for recognition of one's abilities.<br>
<br>
Line of Intuition, beginning at base of Mount Mercury, extends around<br>
Mars and Luna; it is frequently found in the Venus, Mercury and Lunar<br>
types of hands; when deeply dented with a triangle on Mount Saturn it<br>
denotes clairvoyant power; if it forms a triangle with Fate Line, or<br>
Life Line, a voyage will be taken.<br>
<br>
Health Line commences at center of the Rascettes, takes an oblique<br>
course from Fate Line, ending toward Mount Mercury. If straight and well<br>
defined, there is little liability to constitutional diseases; when it<br>
does not extend to Head Line, steady mental labor cannot be performed;<br>
when it is broad and deep on Mount Mercury, diminishing as it enters the<br>
Life Line, death from heart disease is indicated; small lines cutting it<br>
denote sickness from biliousness. When joined to Heart Line, health and<br>
business are neglected for Love; if made up of short, fine lines, there<br>
is suffering from stomach catarrh; if it is checked by islands there is<br>
a constitutional tendency to lung disease.<br>
<br>
Marriage Lines extend straight across Mount Mercury; if short, affairs<br>
of the heart without marriage are denoted. When near Heart Line early<br>
marriage is indicated; if it turns directly to Heart Line, marriage will<br>
occur between the ages of 16 and 21; if close to the top of the mount,<br>
marriage will not take place before the 35th year; if it curves upward<br>
it indicates a single life; when pronged and running toward the center<br>
or to Mount Mars, divorce will occur. If the end at this line droops the<br>
subject will outlive wife or husband; if broken, divorce is implied; if<br>
it ends in a cross, the wife or husband will die from an accident. A<br>
branch from this line upward implies a high position attained by<br>
marriage. A black spot on this line means widowhood.<br>
<br>
Children's Lines are small and upright, extending from the end of<br>
Marriage Lines. If broad and well defined, males; if fine and narrow,<br>
females are indicated. A line of this order that is deep and well<br>
defined denotes prominence for that child.<br>
<br>
Small Lines have a signification depending upon their position and<br>
number.<br>
<br>
A single line on Jupiter signifies success; on Saturn, happiness; on<br>
Apollo, fame and talent.<br>
<br>
Ascending small lines are favorable, while descending lines are<br>
unfavorable signs.<br>
<br>
Several small lines on Mars indicate warfare constantly.<br>
<br>
Cross lines, failure.<br>

OPPORTUNITY.<br>

Master of human destinies am I.<br>
Fame, Love and Fortune on my footsteps wait.<br>
Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate<br>
Deserts and seas remote, and, passing by<br>
Hovel, and mart, and palace, soon or late<br>
I knock unbidden once at every gate!<br>
If sleeping, wake--if feasting, rise before<br>
I turn away. It is the hour of fate,<br>
And they who follow me reach every state<br>
Mortals desire, and conquer every foe<br>
Condemned to failure, penury, and woe.<br>
Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,<br>
Seek me in vain and uselessly implore:<br>
I answer not, and I return no more.<br>

A little health, a little wealth,<br>

&nbsp; I would fly to you, love, nor miss you;<br>
I would sip and sip from your nectared lip,<br>
&nbsp; And kiss you--kiss you--kiss you.<br>

Strange--is it not?--that of the myriads who<br>
Before us passed the door of darkness through,<br>
&nbsp; Not one returns to tell us of the road,<br>
Which to discover, we must travel too?<br>

<br>
Away with the flimsy idea that life with a past is attended.<br>
There's now--only now--and no past. There's never a past; it has ended.<br>
Away with the obsolete story and all of its yesterday sorrow!<br>
There's only Today, almost gone, and in front of Today stands Tomorrow.<br>

<br>
See the mountains kiss high heaven,<br>
&nbsp; And the waves clasp one another;<br>
No sister flower would be forgiven<br>
&nbsp; If it disdained its brother;<br>
And the sunlight clasps the earth,<br>
&nbsp; And the moonbeams kiss the sea;<br>
What are all these kissings worth,<br>
&nbsp; If thou kiss not me?<br>

Jest a-wearyin' for you,<br>
All the time a-feelin' blue;<br>
Wishin' for you, wonderin' when<br>
You'll be comin' home again;<br>
Restless--don't know what to do--<br>
Jest a-wearyin' for you.<br>

Here's to Love, the worker of miracles. He strengthens the weak and<br>
weakens the strong; he turns wise men into fools and fools into wise<br>
men; he feeds the passions and destroys reason, and plays havoc among<br>
young and old!<br>

"Good Bye, God Bless You."<br>
<br>
I like the Anglo--Saxon speech<br>
&nbsp; With its direct revealings;<br>
It takes a hold, and seems to reach<br>
&nbsp; Way down into our feelings<br>
That Some folks deem it rude, I know,<br>
&nbsp; And therefore they abuse it;<br>
But I have never found it so--<br>
&nbsp; Before all else I choose it.<br>
I don't object that men should air<br>
&nbsp; The Gallic they have paid for,<br>
With "Au revoir," "Adieu, ma chere,"<br>
&nbsp; For that's what French was made for.<br>
But when a crony takes your hand<br>
&nbsp; At parting to address you,<br>
He drops all foreign lingo and<br>
&nbsp; He says, "Good--bye, God bless you."<br>

<br>
Five Hundred Common Errors Corrected<br>
<br>
Concise Rules for the Proper Use of Words in Writing or Speaking.<br>
<br>
The most objectionable errors in speaking or writing are those in which<br>
words are employed that are unsuitable to convey the meaning intended.<br>
Thus, a person wishing to express his intention of going to a given<br>
place says, "I propose going," when, in fact, he purposes going. The<br>
following affords an amusing illustration of this class of error: A<br>
venerable matron was speaking of her son, who, she said, was quite<br>
stage-struck: "In fact," remarked the old lady, "he is going to a<br>
premature performance this evening!" Considering that most amateur<br>
performances are premature, it cannot be said that this word was<br>
altogether misapplied, though, evidently, the maternal intention was to<br>
convey quite another meaning.<br>
<br>
Other errors arise from the substitution of sounds similar to the words<br>
which should be employed; that is, spurious words instead of genuine<br>
ones. Thus, some people say "renumerative," when they mean<br>
"remunerative." A nurse, recommending her mistress to have a<br>
perambulator for her child, advised her to purchase a preamputator!<br>
<br>
Other errors are occasioned by imperfect knowledge of English grammar;<br>
thus, many people say, "Between you and I," instead of "Between you and<br>
me." And there are numerous other departures from the rules of grammar,<br>
which will be pointed out hereafter.<br>
<br>
Misuse of the Adjective--"What beautiful butter!" "What a nice<br>
landscape!" They should say, "What a beautiful landscape!" "What nice<br>
butter!" Again, errors are frequently occasioned by the following<br>
causes:<br>
<br>
Mispronunciation of Words--Many persons say pronoun-ciation instead of<br>
pronunciation; others say pro-nun-ce-a-shun, instead of<br>
pro-nun-she-a-shun.<br>
<br>
Misdivision of Words and Syllables--This defect makes the words an<br>
ambassador sound like a nambassador, or an adder like a nadder.<br>
<br>
Imperfect Enunciation--As when a person says hebben for heaven, ebber<br>
for ever, jocholate for chocolate.<br>
<br>
To correct these errors by a systematic course of study would involve a<br>
closer application than most persons could afford, but the simple and<br>
concise rules and hints here given, founded upon usage and the authority<br>
of scholars, will be of great assistance to inquirers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ENGLISH GRAMMAR IN A NUTSHELL.</span><br>
<br>
Who and whom are used in relation to persons, and which in relation to<br>
things. But it was once common to say, "the man which." This should now<br>
be avoided. It is now usual to say, "Our Father who art in heaven,"<br>
instead of "which art in heaven."<br>
<br>
Whose is, however, sometimes applied to things as well as to persons. We<br>
may therefore say, "The country whose inhabitants are free."<br>
<br>
Thou is employed in solemn discourse, and you in common language. Ye<br>
(plural) is also used in serious addresses, and you in familiar<br>
language.<br>
<br>
The uses of the word it are various, and very perplexing to the<br>
uneducated. It is not only used to imply persons, but things, and even<br>
ideas, and therefore in speaking or writing, its assistance is<br>
constantly required. The perplexity respecting this word arises from the<br>
fact that in using it in the construction of a long sentence, sufficient<br>
care is not taken to insure that when it is employed it really points<br>
out or refers to the object intended. For instance, "It was raining when<br>
John set out in his cart to go to market, and he was delayed so long<br>
that it was over before he arrived." Now what is to be understood by<br>
this sentence: Was the rain over? or the market? Either or both might be<br>
inferred from the construction of the sentence, which, therefore, should<br>
be written thus: "It was raining when John set out in his cart to go to<br>
market, and he was delayed so long that the market was over before he<br>
arrived."<br>
<br>
Rule--After writing a sentence always look through it, and see that<br>
wherever the word it is employed, it refers to or carries the mind back<br>
to the object which it is intended to point out.<br>
<br>
The general distinction between this and that may be thus defined: this<br>
denotes an object present or near, in time or place; that something<br>
which is absent.<br>
<br>
These refers, in the same manner, to present objects, while those refers<br>
to things that are remote.<br>
<br>
Who changes, under certain conditions, into whose and whom; but that and<br>
which always remain the same, with the exception of the possessive case,<br>
as noted above.<br>
<br>
That may be applied to nouns or subjects of all sorts; as, the girl that<br>
went to school, the dog that bit me, the opinion that he entertains.<br>
<br>
The misuse of these pronouns gives rise to more errors in speaking and<br>
writing than any other cause.<br>
<br>
When you wish to distinguish between two or more persons, say: "Which is<br>
the happy man?" not who--"Which of those ladies to you admire?"<br>
<br>
Instead of "Whom do you think him to be?" say, "Who do you think him to<br>
be?"<br>
<br>
Whom should I see.<br>
<br>
To whom do you speak?<br>
<br>
Who said so?<br>
<br>
Who gave it to you?<br>
<br>
Of whom did you procure them?<br>
<br>
Who was he?<br>
<br>
Who do men say that I am?<br>
<br>
Self should never be added to his, their, mine or thine.<br>
<br>
Each is used to denote every individual of a number.<br>
<br>
Every denotes all the individuals of a number.<br>
<br>
Either and or denote an alternative: "I will take either road, at your<br>
pleasure;" "I will take this or that."<br>
<br>
Neither means not either, and nor means not the other. Either is<br>
sometimes used for each--"Two thieves were crucified, on either side<br>
one."<br>
<br>
"Let each esteem others as good as themselves," should be, "Let each<br>
esteem others as good as himself."<br>
<br>
"There are bodies each of which are so small," should be, "each of which<br>
is so small."<br>
<br>
Do not use double superlatives, such as most straightest, most highest,<br>
most finest.<br>
<br>
The term worser has gone out of use; but lesser is stilt retained.<br>
<br>
The use of such words as chiefest, extreamest, etc., has become<br>
obsolete, because they do not give any superior force to the meanings of<br>
the primary words, chief, extreme, etc.<br>
<br>
Such expressions as more impossible, more indispensable, more universal,<br>
more uncontrollable, more unlimited, etc., are objectionable, as they<br>
really enfeeble the meaning which it is the object of the speaker or<br>
writer to strengthen. For instance, impossible gains no strength by<br>
rendering it more impossible. This class of error is common with persons<br>
who say, "A great large house," "A great big animal," "A little small<br>
foot," "A tiny little hand."<br>
<br>
Here, there and where, originally denoting place, may now, by common<br>
consent, be used to denote other meanings, such as, "There I agree with<br>
you," "Where we differ," "We find pain where we expected pleasure,"<br>
"Here you mistake me."<br>
<br>
Hence, whence and thence, denoting departure, etc., may be used without<br>
the word from. The idea of from is included in the word<br>
whence--therefore it is unnecessary to say "From whence."<br>
<br>
Hither, thither and whither, denoting to a place, have generally been<br>
superseded by here, there and where. But there is no good reason why<br>
they should not be employed. If, however, they are used, it is<br>
unnecessary to add the word to, because that is implied--"Whither are<br>
you going?" "Where are you going?" Each of these sentences is complete.<br>
To say, "Where are you going to?" is redundant.<br>
<br>
Two negatives destroy each other, and produce an affirmative. "Nor did<br>
he not observe them," conveys the idea that he did observe them.<br>
<br>
But negative assertions are allowable. "His manners are not impolite,"<br>
which implies that his manners are in some degree marked by politeness.<br>
<br>
Instead of "Let you and I." say "Let you and me."<br>
<br>
Instead of "I am not so tall as him," say "I am not so tall as he."<br>

Avoid such phrases as "I said, says I," "Thinks I to myself," etc.<br>
<br>
Instead of "I don't think so," say "I think not."<br>
<br>
Instead of "He was in eminent danger," say "He was in imminent danger."<br>
<br>
Instead of "The weather is hot," say "The weather is very warm."<br>
<br>
Instead of "I sweat," say "I perspire."<br>
<br>
Instead of "I only want two dollars," say "I want only two dollars."<br>
<br>
Instead of "Whatsomever," say "Whatever," or "Whatsoever."<br>
<br>
Avoid such exclamations as "God bless me!" "God deliver me!" "By God!"<br>
"By Gosh!" "Holy Lord!" "Upon my soul!" etc., which are vulgar on the
one<br>
hand, and savor of impiety all the other, for--"Thou shalt not take the<br>
name of the Lord thy God in vain."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCENT AND PRONUNCIATION.</span><br>
<br>
Accent is a particular stress or force of the voice upon certain<br>
syllables or words. This mark in printing denotes the syllable upon<br>
which the stress or force of the voice should be placed.<br>
<br>
A word may have more than one accent. Take as an instance aspiration. In<br>
uttering the word we give a marked emphasis of the voice upon the first<br>
and third syllables, and therefore those syllables are said to be<br>
accented. The first of these accents is less distinguishable than the<br>
second, upon which we dwell longer; therefore the second accent in point<br>
of order is called the primary, or chief accent of the word.<br>
<br>
When the full accent falls on a vowel, that vowel should have a long<br>
sound, as in vo'cal; but when it falls on or after a consonant, the<br>
preceding vowel has a short sound, as in hab'it.<br>
<br>
To obtain a good knowledge of pronunciation it is advisable for the<br>
reader to listen to the examples given by good speakers, and by educated<br>
persons. We learn the pronunciation of words, to a great extent, by<br>
imitation, just as birds acquire the notes of other birds which may be<br>
near them.<br>
<br>
But it will be very important to bear in mind that there are many words<br>
having a double meaning or application, and that the difference of<br>
meaning is indicated by the difference of the accent, Among these words,<br>
nouns are distinguished from verbs by this means: nouns are mostly<br>
accented on the first syllabic, and verbs on the last.<br>
<br>
Noun signifies name; nouns are the names of persons and things, as well<br>
as of things not material and palpable, but of which we have a<br>
conception and knowledge, such as courage, firmness, goodness, strength;<br>
and verbs express actions, movements, etc. If the word used signifies<br>
has been done, or is being done, or is, or is to be done, then that word<br>
is a verb.<br>
<br>
Thus when we say that anything is "an in'sult," that word is a noun, and<br>
is accented all the first syllable; but when we say he did it "to<br>
insult' another person," that word insult' implies acting, and becomes a<br>
verb, and should be accented on the last syllable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Simple Rules of Pronunciation.<br>
<br>
C before a, o and u, and in some other situations, is a close<br>
articulation, like k. Before e, i and y, c is precisely equivalent to s<br>
in same, this; as in cedar, civil, cypress, capacity.<br>
<br>
E final indicates that the preceding vowel is long; as in hate, mete,<br>
sire, robe, lyre, abate, recede, invite, remote, intrude.<br>
<br>
E final indicates that c preceding has the sound of s; as in lace,<br>
lance, and that g preceding has the sound of j, as in charge, page,<br>
challenge.<br>
<br>
E final in proper English words never forms a syllable, and in the most<br>
used words in the terminating unaccented syllables it is silent. Thus,<br>
motive, genuine, examine, granite, are pronounced motiv, genuin, examin,<br>
granit.<br>
<br>
E final, in a few words of foreign origin, forms a syllable; as syncope,<br>
simile.<br>
<br>
E final is silent after l in the following terminations: ble, cle, dle,<br>
fle, gle, kle, ple, tle, zle; as in able, manacle, cradle, ruffle,<br>
mangle, wrinkle, supple, rattle, puzzle, which are pronounced a'bl,<br>
mana'cl, cra'dl, ruf'fl, man'gl, wrin'kl, sup'pl, puz'zl.<br>
<br>
E is usually silent in the termination en; as in taken, broken;<br>
pronounced takn, brokn. OUS, in the termination of adjectives and their<br>
derivatives, is pronounced us; as is gracious, pious, pompously.<br>
<br>
CE, CI, TI, before a vowel, have the sound of sh; as in cetaceous,<br>
gracious, motion, partial, ingratiate;&nbsp; pronounced cetashus,
grashus,<br>
moshun, parshal, ingrashiate.<br>
<br>
SI, after an accented vowel, is pronounced like zh; as in Ephesian,<br>
coufusion; pronounced Ephezhan, confushon.<br>
<br>
GH, both in the middle and at the end of words is silent; as in caught,<br>
bought, fright, nigh, sigh; pronounced caut, baut, frite, ni, si. In the<br>
following exceptions, however, gh is pronounced as f: cough, chough,<br>
clough, enough, laugh, rough, slough, tough, trough.<br>
<br>
When WH begins a word, the aspirate h precedes w in pronunciation: as in<br>
what, whiff, whale; pronounced hwat, hwiff, hwale, w having precisely<br>
the sound of oo, French ou. In the following words w is silent:---who,<br>
whom, whose, whoop, whole.<br>
<br>
H after r has no sound or use; as in rheum, rhyme; pronounced reum,<br>
ryme.<br>
<br>
H should be sounded in the middle of words; as in forehead, abhor,<br>
behold, exhaust, inhabit, unhorse.<br>
<br>
H should always be sounded except in the following words:--heir, herb,<br>
honest, honor, hour, humor, and humble, and all their derivatives,--such<br>
as humorously, derived from humor.<br>
<br>
K and G are silent before n; as know, gnaw; pronounced no, naw.<br>
<br>
W before r is silent; as in wring, wreath; pronounced ring, reath.<br>
<br>
B after m is silent; as in dumb, numb; pronounced dum, num.<br>
<br>
L before k is silent; as in balk, walk, talk; pronounced bauk, wauk,<br>
tauk.<br>
<br>
PH has the sound of f; as in philosophy; pronounced&nbsp; filosofy.<br>
<br>
NG has two sounds, one as in singer, the other as in fin-ger.<br>
<br>
N after m, and closing a syllable, is silent; as in hymn, condemn.<br>
<br>
P before s and t is mute; as in psalm, pseudo, ptarmigan; pronounced<br>
salm, sudo, tarmigan.<br>
<br>
R has two sounds, one strong and vibrating, as at the beginning of words<br>
and syllables, such as robber, reckon, error; the other is at the<br>
termination of the words, or when succeeded by a consonant, as farmer,<br>
morn.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SHORT RULES FOR SPELLING.</span><br>
<br>
Words ending in e drop that letter on taking a suffix beginning with a<br>
vowel. Exceptions--words ending in ge, ce, or oe.<br>
<br>
Final e of a primitive word is retained on taking a suffix beginning<br>
with a consonant. Exceptions--words ending in dge, and truly, duly, etc.<br>
<br>
Final y of a primitive word, when preceded by a consonant, is generally<br>
changed into i on the addition of a suffix. Exceptions--retained before<br>
ing and ish, as pitying. Words ending in ie and dropping the e by Rule<br>
1, change the i to y, as lying. Final y is sometimes changed to e, as<br>
duteous.<br>
<br>
Nouns ending in y, preceded by a vowel, form their plural by adding s; o<br>
as money, moneys. Y preceded by a consonant is changed to ies in the<br>
plural; as bounty, bounties.<br>
<br>
Final y of a primitive vowel, preceded by a vowel, should not be changed<br>
into i before a suffix; as, joyless.<br>
<br>
In words containing ei or ie, ei is used after the sound s, as ceiling,<br>
seize, except in siege and in a few words ending in cier. Inveigle,<br>
neither, leisure and weird also have ei. In other cases ie is used, as<br>
in believe, achieve.<br>
<br>
Words ending in ceous or cious, when relating to matter, end in ceous;<br>
all others in cious.<br>
<br>
Words of one syllable, ending in a consonant; with a single vowel before<br>
it, double the consonant in derivatives; as, ship, shipping, etc. But if<br>
ending in a consonant with a double vowel before it, they do not double<br>
the consonant in derivatives; as troop, trooper, etc.<br>
<br>
Words of more than one syllable, ending in a consonant preceded by a<br>
single vowel, and accented on the last syllable, double that consonant<br>
in derivatives; as commit, committed; but except chagrin, chagrined;<br>
kidnap, kidnaped.<br>
<br>
All words of one syllable ending in l, with a single vowel before it,<br>
have ll at the close; as mill, sell.<br>
<br>
All words of one syllable ending in l, with a double vowel before it,<br>
have only one l at the close: as mail, sail.<br>
<br>
The words foretell, distill, instill and fulfill retain the double ll of<br>
their primitives. Derivatives of dull, skill, will and full also retain<br>
the double ll when the accent falls on these words; as dullness,<br>
skillful, willful, fullness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PUNCTUATION.</span><br>
<br>
A period (.) after every declarative and every imperative sentence; as,<br>
It is true. Do right.<br>
<br>
A period is also used after every abbreviation; as, Dr., Mr., Capt.<br>
<br>
An interrogation point (?) after every question.<br>
<br>
The exclamation point (!) after exclamations; as, Alas! Oh, how lovely!<br>
<br>
Quotation marks (" ") inclose quoted expressions; as Socrates said: "I<br>
believe the soul is immortal."<br>
<br>
A colon (:) is used between parts of a sentence that are subdivided by<br>
semi-colons.<br>
<br>
A colon is used before a quotation, enumeration, or observation, that is<br>
introduced by as follows, the following, or any similar expression; as,<br>
Send me the following: 10 doz. "Armstrong's Treasury," 25 Schulte's<br>
Manual, etc.<br>
<br>
A semicolon (;) between parts that are subdivided by commas.<br>
<br>
The semicolon is used also between clauses or members that are<br>
disconnected in sense; as, Man grows old; he passes away; all is<br>
uncertain. When as, namely, that is, is used to introduce an example or<br>
enumeration, a semicolon is put before it and a comma after it; as, The<br>
night was cold; that is, for the time of year.<br>
<br>
A comma is used to set off interposed words, phrases and subordinate<br>
clauses not restrictive; as, Good deeds are never lost, though sometimes<br>
forgotten.<br>
<br>
A comma is used to set off transposed phrases and clauses, as, "When the<br>
wicked entice thee, consent thou not."<br>
<br>
A comma is used to set off interposed words, phrases and clauses; as,<br>
Let us, if we can, make others happy.<br>
<br>
A comma is used between similar or repeated words or phrases; as, The<br>
sky, the water, the trees, were illumined with sunlight.<br>
<br>
A comma is used to mark an ellipsis, or the omission of a verb or other<br>
important word.<br>
<br>
A comma is used to set off a short quotation informally introduced; as,<br>
Who said, "The good die young"?<br>
<br>
A comma is used whenever necessary to prevent ambiguity.<br>
<br>
The marks of parenthesis ( ) are used to inclose an interpolation where<br>
such interpolation is by the writer or speaker of the sentence in which<br>
it occurs. Interpolations by an editor or by anyone other than the<br>
author of the sentence should be inclosed in brackets--[ ].<br>
<br>
Dashes (--) may be used to set off a parenthetical expression, also to<br>
denote an interruption or a sudden change of thought or a significant<br>
pause.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE USE OF CAPITALS.</span><br>
<br>
1. Every entire sentence should begin with a capital.<br>
<br>
2. Proper names, and adjectives derived from these, should begin with a<br>
capital.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">FACTS ABOUT SPONGES.</span><br>
By Albert Hart.<br>
<br>
Sponges belong to the animal kingdom, and the principal varieties used<br>
commercially are obtained off the coasts of Florida and the West Indies;<br>
the higher grades are from the Mediterranean Sea, and are numerous in<br>
variety.<br>
<br>
A sponge in its natural state is a different-looking object from what we<br>
see in commerce, resembling somewhat the appearance of the jelly fish,<br>
or a mass of liver, the entire surface being covered with a thin, slimy<br>
skin, usually of a dark color, and perforated to correspond with the<br>
apertures of the canals commonly called "holes of the sponge." The<br>
sponge of commerce is, in reality, only the skeleton of a sponge. The<br>
composition of this skeleton varies in the different kinds of sponges,<br>
but in the commercial grades it consists of interwoven horny fibers,<br>
among and supporting which are epiculae of silicious matter in greater<br>
or less numbers, and having a variety of forms. The fibers consist of a<br>
network of fibriles, whose softness and elasticity determine the<br>
commercial quality of a given sponge. The horny framework is perforated<br>
externally by very minute pores, and by a less number of larger<br>
openings. These are parts of an interesting double canal system, an<br>
external and an internal, or a centripetal and a centrifugal. At the<br>
smaller openings on the sponge's surface channels begin, which lead into<br>
dilated spaces. In these, in turn, channels arise, which eventually<br>
terminate in the large openings. Through these channels or canals<br>
definite currents are constantly maintained, which are essential to the<br>
life of the sponge. The currents enter through the small apertures and<br>
emerge through the large ones.<br>
<br>
The active part of the sponge, that is, the part concerned in nutrition<br>
and growth, is a soft, fleshy mass, partly filling the meshes and lining<br>
the canals. It consists largely of cells having different functions;<br>
some utilized in the formation of the framework, some in digestion and<br>
others in reproduction. Lining the dilated spaces into which different<br>
canals lead are cells surmounted by whip-like processes. The motion of<br>
these processes produces and maintains the water currents, which carry<br>
the minute food products to the digestive cells in the same cavities.<br>
Sponges multiply by the union of sexual product. Certain cells of the<br>
fleshy pulp assume the character of ova, and others that of spermatozoa.<br>
Fertilization takes place within the sponge. The fertilized eggs, which<br>
are called larvae, pass out into the currents of the water, and, in the<br>
course of twenty-four to forty-eight hours, they settle and become<br>
attached to rocks and other hard substances, and in time develop into<br>
mature sponges. The depth of the water in which sponges grow varies from<br>
10 to 50 feet in Florida, but considerably more in the Mediterranean<br>
Sea, the finer grades being found in the deepest water, having a<br>
temperature of 50 to 57 degrees.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DON'T BE BURIED ALIVE.</span><br>
<br>
From time to time we are horrified by learning that some person has been<br>
buried alive, after assurances have been given of death. Under these<br>
circumstances the opinion of a rising French physician upon the subject<br>
becomes of world-wide interest, for since the tests which have been in<br>
use for years have been found unreliable no means should be left untried<br>
to prove beyond a doubt that life is actually extinct before conveying<br>
our loved ones to the grave.<br>
<br>
Dr. Martinot, as reported in the New York Journal, asserts that an<br>
unfailing test may be made by producing a blister on the hand or foot of<br>
the body by holding the flame of a candle to the same for a few seconds,<br>
or until the blister is formed which will always occur. If the blister<br>
contains any fluid it is evidence of life, and the blister only that<br>
produced by an ordinary burn. If, on the contrary, the blister contains<br>
only steam, it may be asserted that life is extinct. The explanation is<br>
as follows:<br>
<br>
A corpse, says Dr. Martinot, is nothing more than inert matter, under<br>
the immediate control of physical laws which cause all liquid heated to<br>
a certain temperature to become steam; the epidermis is raised, the<br>
blister produced; it breaks with a little noise, and the steam escapes.<br>
But if, in spite of all appearances, there is any remnant of life, the<br>
organic mechanism continues to be governed by physiological laws, and<br>
the blister will contain serous matter, as in the case of any ordinary<br>
burns.<br>
<br>
The test is as simple as the proof is conclusive. Dry blister: death.<br>
Liquid blister: life. Any one may try it; there is no error possible.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO SERVE WINE.</span><br>
<br>
A fine dinner may be spoiled by not serving the proper wine at the<br>
proper time and at the proper temperature.<br>
<br>
A white wine (Sauterne, Riesling, Moselle, etc.) should be used from the<br>
beginning of the meal to the time the roast or game comes on. With the<br>
roast serve red wine, either claret or Burgundy.<br>
<br>
Use sparkling wines after the roast.<br>
<br>
With dessert, serve apricot cordial.<br>
<br>
Never serve red wine with soup or fish, and never a white wine with<br>
game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Storage, Temperature, Etc.<br>
<br>
Store your wines in the cellar at 50 to 60 degrees.<br>
<br>
All bottles should lie flat so that the cork is continually moist.<br>
<br>
This rule should be specially observed with sparkling wines. Sparkling<br>
wine should be served ice cold.<br>
<br>
Put the wine on the ice--not ice in the wine.<br>
<br>
Serve red wine at only about 5 degrees cooler than the dining-room.<br>
<br>
White wine should be about 15 degrees cooler than the temperature of the<br>
room.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE STEPS IN THE GROWTH OF AMERICAN
LIBERTY.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MAGNA CHARTA.</span><br>
<br>
About seven hundred years ago there was organized a movement which<br>
resulted in the great charter of English liberty--a movement which<br>
foreshadowed the battle of our American forefathers for political<br>
independence. On the 25th of August, 1213, the prelates and Barons,<br>
tiring of the tyranny and vacillation of King John, formed a council and<br>
passed measures to secure their rights. After two years of contest, with<br>
many vicissitudes, the Barons entered London and the King fled into<br>
Hampshire. By agreement both parties met at Runnymede on the 9th of<br>
June, 1215, and after several days' debate, on June 15, Magna Charta<br>
(the Great Charter), the glory of England, was signed and sealed by the<br>
sovereign. The Magna Charta is a comprehensive bill of rights, and,<br>
though crude in form, and with many clauses of merely local value, its<br>
spirit still lives and will live. Clear and prominent we find the motto,<br>
"No tax without representation." The original document is in Latin and<br>
contains sixty-one articles, of which the 39th and 40th, embodying the<br>
very marrow of our own State constitutions, are here given as translated<br>
in the English statutes:<br>
<br>
"39. No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseised of his<br>
freehold, or liberties or free customs, or be otherwise destroped<br>
[damaged], nor will be press upon him nor seize upon him [condemn him]<br>
but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.<br>
<br>
"40. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man,<br>
either right or justice."<br>
<br>
The Great Charter recognizes a popular tribunal as a check on the<br>
official judges and may be looked upon as the foundation of the writ of<br>
Habeas Corpus. It provides that no one is to be condemned on rumor or<br>
suspicion, but only on the evidence of witnesses. It affords protection<br>
against excessive emercements, illegal distresses and various processes<br>
for debts and service due to the crown. Fines are in all cases to be<br>
proportionate to the magnitude of the offense, and even the villein or<br>
rustic is not to be deprived of his necessary chattels. There are<br>
provisions regarding the forfeiture of land for felony. The testamentary<br>
power of the subject is recognized over part of his personal estate, and<br>
the rest to be divided between his widow and children. The independence<br>
of the church is also provided for. These are the most important<br>
features of the Great Charter, which, exacted by men with arms in their<br>
hands from a resisting king, occupies so conspicuous a place in history,<br>
which establishes the supremacy of the law of England over the will of<br>
the monarch, and which still forms the basis of English liberties.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MECKLENBURG DECLARATION</span><br>
<br>
More than a year before the signing of the Declaration of Independence a<br>
document was drawn up that was almost a model in phraseology and<br>
sentiment of the great charter of American freedom. There are various<br>
accounts of this matter, but the most trustworthy is this:<br>
<br>
At a public meeting of the residents of Mecklenburg County, North<br>
Carolina, held at Charlotte on the 20th of May, 1775, it was<br>
<br>
"Resolved, That whenever directly or indirectly abetted, or in any way,<br>
form or manner countenanced, the unchartered and dangerous invasion of<br>
our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to our country--to<br>
America--and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.<br>
<br>
"Resolved, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby<br>
dissolve the political bonds which have connected us to the mother<br>
country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British<br>
crown, and abjure all political connection, contract or association with<br>
that nation, which has wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties,<br>
and inhumanly shed the blood of American patriots at Lexington.<br>
<br>
"Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent<br>
people; are and of right ought to be a sovereign and self-governing<br>
association, under the control of no power other than that of our God<br>
and the general government of the Congress. To the maintenance of which<br>
independence we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual cooperation,<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Congress, July 4, 1776</span>.<br>
<br>
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people<br>
to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another,<br>
and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal<br>
station to which the laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle them, a<br>
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should<br>
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br>
<br>
We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal;<br>
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;<br>
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That<br>
to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving<br>
their just powers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any<br>
form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of<br>
the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government,<br>
laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in<br>
such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and<br>
happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long<br>
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and<br>
accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to<br>
suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by<br>
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train<br>
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces<br>
a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it<br>
is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards<br>
for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these<br>
colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter<br>
their former systems of government. The history of the present King of<br>
Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all<br>
having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over<br>
these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.<br>
<br>
He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for<br>
the public good.<br>
<br>
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing<br>
importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should<br>
be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend<br>
to them.<br>
<br>
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large<br>
districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of<br>
representation in the legislature--a right inestimable to them,<br>
formidable to tyrants only.<br>
<br>
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,<br>
uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records,<br>
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with<br>
manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.<br>
<br>
He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others<br>
to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of<br>
annihilation, have returned to the people at large, for their exercise,<br>
the state remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of<br>
invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br>
<br>
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that<br>
purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing<br>
to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising<br>
conditions of new appropriation of lands. He has obstructed the<br>
administration of justice, by refusing his assent to laws establishing<br>
judiciary powers.<br>
<br>
He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their<br>
offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br>
<br>
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of<br>
officers, to harass our people, and to eat out their substance.<br>
<br>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the<br>
consent of our legislatures.<br>
<br>
He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to,<br>
the civil power.<br>
<br>
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to<br>
our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to<br>
their acts of pretended legislation:<br>
<br>
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us. For protecting<br>
them, by mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should<br>
commit on the inhabitants of these States.<br>
<br>
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world. For imposing<br>
taxes on us without our consent.<br>
<br>
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury.<br>
<br>
For transporting us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses.<br>
<br>
For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring<br>
province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging<br>
its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument<br>
for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies.<br>
<br>
For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and<br>
altering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments.<br>
<br>
For suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested<br>
with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br>
<br>
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection,<br>
and waging war against us.<br>
<br>
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and<br>
destroyed the lives of our people.<br>
<br>
He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries,<br>
to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun<br>
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the<br>
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized<br>
nation.<br>
<br>
He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas,<br>
to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their<br>
friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.<br>
<br>
He has excited domestic insurrection among us, and has endeavored to<br>
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages,<br>
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all<br>
ages, sexes and conditions.<br>
<br>
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in<br>
the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by<br>
repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act<br>
which may define a tyrant is unfit to be ruler of a free people.<br>
<br>
Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have<br>
warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to<br>
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of<br>
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have<br>
appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured<br>
them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations,<br>
which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence.<br>
They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.<br>
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our<br>
separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in<br>
war, in peace friends.<br>
<br>
We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in<br>
general Congress assembled, appealing to the supreme Judge of the world<br>
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the<br>
authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and<br>
declare that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free<br>
and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to<br>
the British crown, and that all political connection between them and<br>
the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and<br>
that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy war,<br>
conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce and to do all<br>
other acts and things which independent States may of right do. And for<br>
the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection<br>
of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our<br>
fortunes and our sacred honor.<br>

"He [King George III.] has waged cruel war against human nature itself,<br>

Representatives.<br>
<br>
SECTION II.<br>
<br>
1. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen<br>
every second year by the people of the several States; and the electors<br>
in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of<br>
the most numerous branch of the State legislature.<br>
<br>

<br>
3. Representative and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the<br>
several States which may be included within this Union, according to<br>
their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the<br>
whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a<br>
term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all<br>
other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years<br>
after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within<br>
every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law<br>
direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every<br>

The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the<br>
expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of<br>
the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth<br>
year, so that one-third may be chosen every second year; and if<br>

legislature of any State, the executive thereof may make temporary<br>
appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then<br>
fill such vacancies.<br>
<br>
3. No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age<br>

honor, trust or profit under the United States; but the party convicted<br>
shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment<br>
and punishment, according to law.<br>
<br>
SECTION IV.<br>
<br>
1. The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and<br>
representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature<br>
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such<br>
regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.<br>
<br>
2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year; and such<br>
meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by<br>
law appoint a different day.<br>
<br>
SECTION V.<br>
<br>
1. Each house shall be the judge of the election, returns and<br>
qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall<br>
constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn<br>
from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent<br>
members, in such manner and under such penalties as each house may<br>
provide.<br>
<br>

3. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to<br>
time publish the same, excepting such parts as in their judgment require<br>
secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either house on any<br>
question shall, at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered<br>
on the journal.<br>
<br>

place than that in which the two houses shall be sitting.<br>
<br>
SECTION VI.<br>
<br>
1. The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for<br>
their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury<br>
of the United States. They shall, in all cases, except treason, felony,<br>
and breach of peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance<br>
at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning<br>
from the same; and for any speech or debate in either house they shall<br>
not be questioned in any other place.<br>
<br>
2. No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was<br>
elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the<br>
United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof<br>
shall have been increased, during such time; and no person holding any<br>
office under the United States shall be a member of either house during<br>
his continuance in office.<br>
<br>
SECTION VII.<br>
<br>
1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of<br>
Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as<br>
on other bills.<br>
<br>
2. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and<br>
the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the<br>
President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if<br>
not he shall return it, with his objections, to that house in which it<br>
shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their<br>
journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration,<br>
two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent,<br>
together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall<br>
likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that house,<br>
it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both houses<br>
shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons<br>
voting for or against the bill be entered on the journal of each house<br>
respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within<br>
ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him,<br>
the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless<br>
the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return, in which case it<br>
shall not be a law.<br>
<br>
3. Every order, resolution or vote to which the concurrence of the<br>
Senate and the House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a<br>
question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the<br>
United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved<br>
by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of<br>
the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and<br>
limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.<br>
<br>
SECTION VIII.<br>
<br>
The Congress shall have power--<br>
<br>
1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises to pay the<br>

10. To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high<br>

<br>
13. To provide and maintain a navy;<br>

naval forces;<br>
<br>
15. To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the<br>
Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;<br>
<br>
16. To provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and<br>
for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the<br>
United States, reserving to the States, respectively, the appointment of<br>
the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the<br>
discipline prescribed by Congress;<br>
<br>
17. To exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over<br>
such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of<br>
particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of<br>
the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over<br>
all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in<br>
which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,<br>
dock-yards, and other needful buildings;<br>
<br>
And to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying<br>
into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by the<br>
Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any<br>
department or officer thereof.<br>
<br>

of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with<br>

<br>
Article II.<br>
<br>
SECTION I.<br>
<br>
1. The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United<br>
States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four<br>
years; and, together with the Vice-President chosen for the same term,<br>
be elected as follows:<br>
<br>
2. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof<br>
may direct, a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators<br>
and representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress;<br>
but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust<br>
or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.<br>
<br>
3. The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by<br>
ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant<br>
of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the<br>
persons voted for and of the number of votes for each; which list they<br>
shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of government of<br>
the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The<br>
President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House<br>
of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then<br>
be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the<br>
President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors<br>
appointed; and if there be more than one who have such a majority, and<br>
have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall<br>
immediately choose, by ballot, one of them for President, and if no<br>
person have a majority, then, from the five highest on the list, the<br>
said House shall, in like manner, choose the President. But in choosing<br>
the President the votes shall be taken by States, the representation<br>
from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist<br>
of a member or members from two-thirds of all the States, and a majority<br>
of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after<br>
the choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of<br>
votes of the electors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should<br>
remain two or more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from<br>
them, by ballot, the Vice-President.<br>
<br>
4. The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the<br>
day on which they shall give their votes, which day shall be the same<br>
throughout the United States.<br>
<br>
5. No person, except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United<br>
States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be<br>
eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be<br>
eligible to that office who shall not have attained the age of<br>
thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United<br>
States.<br>
<br>
6. In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death,<br>
resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said<br>
office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President; and the Congress<br>
may, by law, provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or<br>

laryngitis. He died at the age of 68, on Dec. 14, 1799.<br>
<br>
John Adams died from old age, having reached his ninety-first milestone.<br>
Though active mentally, he was nearly blind and unable to hold a pen<br>
steadily enough to write. He passed away without pain on July 4, 1826.<br>
<br>
Thomas Jefferson died at the age of eighty-three, a few hours before<br>
Adams, on July 4, 1826. His disease was chronic diarrhoea, superinduced<br>
by old age, and his physician said the too free use of the waters of the<br>
white sulphur springs.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ART OF NOT FORGETTING.</span><br>
<br>
A Brief but Comprehensive Treatise Based on Loisette's Famous System of<br>
Memory Culture.<br>
<br>
So much has been said about Loisette's memory system, the art has been<br>
so widely advertised, and so carefully guarded from all the profane who<br>
do not send five or many dollars to the Professor, that a few pages,<br>
showing how man may be his own Loisette, may be both interesting and<br>
valuable.<br>
<br>
In the first place, the system is a good one, and well worth the labor<br>
of mastering, and if the directions are implicitly followed there can be<br>
no doubt that the memory will be greatly strengthened and improved, and<br>
that the mnemonic feats otherwise impossible may be easily performed.<br>
Loisette, however, is not an inventor, but an introducer. He stands in<br>
the same relation to Dr. Pick that the retail dealer holds to the<br>
manufacturer: the one produced the article, the other brings it to the<br>
public. Even this statement is not quite fair to Loisette, for he has<br>
brought much practical common sense to bear upon Pick's system, and, in<br>
preparing the new art of mnemonics for the market, in many ways he has<br>
made it his own.<br>
<br>
If each man would reflect upon the method by which he himself remembers<br>
things, he would find his hand upon the key of the whole mystery. For<br>
instance, I was once trying to remember the word "Blythe." There<br>
occurred to my mind the words "Bellman," "Belle," and the verse:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "---- the peasant upward climbing<br>
&nbsp; Hears the bells of Buloss chiming."<br>
<br>
"Barcarole," "Barrack," and so on, until finally the word "Blythe"<br>
presented itself with a strange insistence, long after I had ceased<br>
trying to recall it.<br>
<br>
On another occasion, when trying to recall the name "Richardson," I got<br>
the words "hay-rick," "Robertson," "Randallstown," and finally<br>
"wealthy," from which, naturally, I got "rich" and "Richardson" almost<br>
in a breath.<br>
<br>
Still another example: Trying to recall the name of an old schoolmate,<br>
"Grady," I got "Brady," "grave," "gaseous," "gastronome," "gracious,"<br>
and I finally abandoned the attempt, simply saying to myself that it<br>
began with a "G," and there was an "a" sound after it. The next morning<br>
when thinking of something entirely different, this name "Grady" came up<br>
in my mind with as much distinctness as though someone had whispered it<br>
in my ear. This remembering was done without any conscious effort on my<br>
part, and was evidently the result of the exertion made the day before<br>
when the mnemonic processes were put to work. Every reader must have had<br>
a similar experience which he can recall, and which will fall in line<br>
with the examples given.<br>
<br>
It follows, then, that when we endeavor, without the aid of any system,<br>
to recall a forgotten fact or name, our memory presents to us words of<br>
similar sound or meaning in its journey toward the goal to which we have<br>
started it. This goes to show that our ideas are arranged in groups in<br>
whatever secret cavity or recess of the brain they occupy, and that the<br>
arrangement is not an alphabetical one exactly, and not entirely by<br>
meaning, but after some fashion partaking of both.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for the word "meadow" you may reach "middle" before<br>
you come to it, or "Mexico," or many, words beginning with the "m"<br>
sound, or containing the "dow", as window, or "dough," or you may get<br>
"field" or "farm"--but you are on the right track, and if you do not<br>
interfere with your intellectual process you will finally come to the<br>
idea which you are seeking.<br>
<br>
How often have you heard people say, "I forget his name, it is something<br>
like Beadle or Beagle--at any rate it begins with a B." Each and all of<br>
these were unconscious Loisettians, and they were practicing blindly,<br>
and without proper method or direction, the excellent system which he<br>
teaches. The thing, then, to do--and it is the final and simple truth<br>
which Loisette teaches--is to travel over this ground in the other<br>
direction--to cement the fact which you wish to remember to some other<br>
fact or word which you know will be brought out by the implied<br>
conditions--and thus you will always be able to travel from your given<br>
starting-point to the thing which you wish to call to mind.<br>
<br>
It seems as though a channel were cut in our mind-stuff along which the<br>
memory flows. How to construct an easy channel for any event or series<br>
of events or facts which one wishes to remember, along which the mind<br>
will ever afterward travel, is the secret of mnemonics.<br>
<br>
Loisette, in common with all the mnemonic teachers, uses the old device<br>
of representing numbers by letters--and as this is the first and easiest<br>
step in the art, this seems to be the most logical place to introduce<br>
the accepted equivalents of the Arabic numerals:<br>
<br>
0 is always represented by s, z or c soft.<br>
<br>
1 is always represented by t, th or d.<br>
<br>
2 is always represented by n.<br>
<br>
3 is always represented by m.<br>
<br>
4 is always represented by r.<br>
<br>
5 is always represented by l.<br>
<br>
6 is always represented by sh, j, ch soft or g soft.<br>
<br>
7 is always represented by g hard, k, c hard, q or final ng.<br>
<br>
8 is always represented by f or v.<br>
<br>
9 is always represented by p or b.<br>
<br>
All the other letters are used simply to fill up. Double letters in a<br>
word count only as one. In fact, the system goes by sound, not by<br>
spelling, For instance, "this" or "dizzy" would stand for ten; "catch"<br>
or "gush" would stand for 76, and the only difficulty is to make some<br>
word or phrase which will contain only the significant letters in the<br>
proper order, filled out with non-significants into some guise of<br>
meaning or intelligibility.<br>
<br>
You can remember the equivalents given above by noting that z is the<br>
first letter of "zero," and c of "cipher," t has but one stroke, n has<br>
two, m three; the script f is very like 8; the script p like 9; r is the<br>
last letter of "four;" l is the Roman numeral for 50, which suggests 5.<br>
The others may be retained by memorizing these nonsense lines:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Six shy Jewesses chase George.<br>
&nbsp; Seven great kings came quarreling.<br>
<br>
Suppose you wished to get some phrase or word that would express the<br>
number 3,685, you arrange the letters this way:<br>

<br>
You can make out "image of law," "my shuffle," "matchville," etc., etc.,<br>
as far as you like to work it out.<br>
<br>
Now, suppose you wished to memorize the fact that $1,000,000 in gold<br>
weighs 3,685 pounds, you go about it in this way, and here is the kernel<br>
and crux of Loisette's system: "How much does $1,000,000 in gold weigh?"<br>
<br>
<br>
"Weigh-scales."<br>
<br>
"Scales--statue of justice."<br>
<br>
"Statue of Justice--image of law."<br>
<br>
The process is simplicity itself. The thing you wish to recall, and that<br>
you fear to forget, is the weight; consequently you cement your chain of<br>
suggestion to the idea which is most prominent in your mental question.<br>
What do you weigh with? Scales. What does the mental picture of scales<br>
suggest? The statue of Justice, blindfolded and weighing out award and<br>
punishment to man. Finally, what is this statue of Justice but the image<br>
of law? And the words "image of law," translated back from the<br>
significant letters m, g soft, f and 1, give you 3--6--8--5, the number<br>
of pounds in $1,000,000 in gold. You bind together in your mind each<br>
separate step in the journey, the one suggests the other, and you will<br>
find a year from now that the fact will be as fresh in your memory as it<br>
is today. You cannot lose it. It is chained to you by an unbreakable<br>
mnemonic tie. Mark that it is not claimed that "weight" will of itself<br>
suggest "scales," and "scales" "statue of Justice," etc., but that,<br>
having once passed your attention up and down that ladder of ideas, your<br>
mental tendency will be to take the same route, and get to the same goal<br>
again and again. Indeed, beginning with the weight of $1,000,000, "image<br>
of law" will turn up in your mind without your consciousness of any<br>
intermediate station on the way, after some iteration and reiteration of<br>
the original chain.<br>
<br>
Again, so as to fasten the process in the reader's mind even more<br>
firmly, suppose that it were desired to fix the date of the battle of<br>
Hastings (A. D. 1066) in the memory; 1066 may be represented by the<br>
words "the wise judge" (th--1, s--0, j--6, dg--6; the others are<br>
non-significants); a chain might be made thus:<br>
<br>
Battle of Hastings--arbitrament of war.<br>
<br>
Arbitrament of war--arbitration.<br>
<br>
Arbitration--judgment.<br>
<br>
Judgment--the wise judge.<br>
<br>
Make mental pictures, connect ideas, repeat words and sounds, go about<br>
it any way you please, so that you will form a mental habit of<br>
connecting the "battle of Hastings" with the idea of "arbitrament of<br>
war," and so on for the other links in the chain, and the work is done.<br>
<br>
Loisette makes the beginning of his system unnecessarily difficult, to<br>
say nothing of his illogical arrangement in the grammar of the art of<br>
memory, which he makes the first of his lessons. He analyzes suggestion<br>
into--<br>
<br>
1. Inclusion.<br>
<br>
2. Exclusion.<br>
<br>
3. Concurrence.<br>
<br>
All of which looks very scientific and orderly, but is really misleading<br>
and badly named. The truth is that one idea will suggest another:<br>
<br>
1. By likeness or opposition of meaning, as "house" suggests "room" or<br>
"door," etc.; or, "white" suggests "black"; "cruel," "kind," etc.<br>
<br>
2. By likeness of sound, as "harrow" and "barrow"; "Henry" and<br>
"Hennepin."<br>
<br>
3. By mental juxtaposition, a peculiarity different in each person, and<br>
depending upon each one's own experiences. Thus, "St. Charles" suggests<br>
"railway bridge" to me, because I was vividly impressed by the breaking<br>
of the Wabash bridge at that point. "Stable" and "broken leg" come near<br>
each other in my experience, as do "cow" and "shot-gun" and "licking."<br>
<br>
Out of these three sorts of suggestion it is possible to get from anyone<br>
fact to another in a chain certain and safe, along which the mind may be<br>
depended upon afterwards always to follow.<br>
<br>
The chain is, of course, by no means all. Its making and its binding<br>
must be accompanied by a vivid, methodically directed attention, which<br>
turns all the mental light gettable in a focus upon the subject passing<br>
across the mind's screen. Before Loisette was thought of this was known.<br>
In the old times in England, in order to impress upon the mind of the<br>
rising generation the parish boundaries in the rural districts, the boys<br>
were taken to each of the landmarks in succession, the position and<br>
bearing of each pointed out carefully, and, in order to deepen the<br>
impression, the young people were then and there vigorously thrashed--a<br>
mechanical method of attracting the attention which was said never to<br>
have failed. This system has had its supporters in many of the<br>
old-fashioned schools, and there are men who will read these lines who<br>
can recall, with an itching sense of vivid impression, the 144 lickings<br>
which were said to go with the multiplication table.<br>
<br>
In default of a thrashing, however, the student must cultivate as best<br>
he can an intense fixity of perception upon every fact or word or date<br>
that he wishes to make permanently his own. It is easy. It is a matter<br>
of habit. If you will, you can photograph an idea upon your cerebral<br>
gelatine so that neither years nor events will blot it out or overlay<br>
it. You must be clearly and distinctly aware of the thing you are<br>
putting into your mental treasure-house, and drastically certain of the<br>
cord by which you have tied it to some other thing of which you are<br>
sure. Unless it is worth your while to do this, you might as well<br>
abandon any hope of mnemonic improvement, which will not come without<br>
the hardest kind of hard work, although it is work that will grow<br>
constantly easier with practice and reiteration. You need, then:<br>
<br>
1. Methodic suggestion.<br>
<br>
2. Methodic attention.<br>
<br>
3. Methodic reiteration.<br>
<br>
And this is all there is to Loisette, and a great deal it is. Two of<br>
them will not do without the third. You do not know how many steps there<br>
are from your hall door to your bedroom, though you have attended to and<br>
often reiterated the journey. But if there are twenty of them, and you<br>
have once bound the word "nice," or "nose," or "news" or "hyenas," to<br>
the fact of the stairway, you can never forget it.<br>
<br>
The Professor makes a point, and very wisely, of the importance of<br>
working through some established chain, so that the whole may be carried<br>
away in the mind--not alone for the value of the facts so bound<br>
together, but for the mental discipline so afforded.<br>
<br>
Here, then, is the "President Series," which contains the name and date<br>
of inauguration of each President from Washington to Cleveland. The<br>
manner in which it is to be mastered is this: Beginning at the top, try<br>
to find in your mind some connection between each word and the one<br>
following it. See how you can at some future time make one suggest the<br>
next, either by suggestion of sound or sense, or by mental<br>
juxtaposition. When you have found this dwell on it attentively for a<br>
moment or two. Pass it backward and forward before you, and then go on<br>
to the next step.<br>
<br>
The chain runs thus, the names of the President being in capitals, the<br>
date words or date phrases being inclosed in parentheses:<br>
<br>
President&nbsp; Chosen for the first word as the one most apt to occur
to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mind of
anyone wishing to repeat the names of the Presidents.<br>
<br>
Dentist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President and dentist.<br>
<br>

dentist do?<br>
<br>
(To give up)&nbsp; When something is drawn from one it is given up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is a date phrase meaning 1789.<br>

TAFT<br>
<br>
It will be noted that some of the date words, as "free will," only give<br>
three figures of the date, 845; but it is to be supposed that if the<br>
student knows that many figures in the date of Polk's inauguration he<br>
can guess the other one.<br>
<br>
The curious thing about this system will now become apparent. If the<br>
reader has learned the series so that he can say it down from President<br>
to Taft, he can with no effort, and without any further preparation, say<br>
it backwards from Taft up to the commencement! There could be no better<br>
proof that this is the natural mnemonic system. It proves itself by its<br>
works.<br>
<br>
The series should be repeated backward and forward every day for a<br>
month, and should be supplemented by a series of the reader's own<br>
making, and by this one, which gives the numbers from 0 to 100, and<br>
which must be chained together before they can be learned:<br>

<br>
By the use of this table, which should be committed as thoroughly as the<br>
President series, so that it can be repeated backward and forward, any<br>
date, figure or number can be at once constructed, and bound by the<br>
usual chain to the fact which you wish it to accompany.<br>
<br>
When the student wishes to go farther and attack larger problems than<br>
the simple binding of two facts together, there is little in Loisette's<br>
system that is new, although there is much that is good. If it is a book<br>
that is to be learned as one would prepare for an examination, each<br>
chapter is to be considered separately. Of each an epitome is to be<br>
written in which the writer must exercise all of his ingenuity to reduce<br>
the matter in hand to its final skeleton of fact. This he is to commit<br>
to memory both by the use of the chain and the old system of<br>
interrogation. Suppose after much labor through a wide space of language<br>
one boils a chapter or an event down to the final irreducible sediment:<br>
"Magna Charta was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede."<br>
<br>
You must now turn this statement this way and that way; asking yourself<br>
about it every possible and impossible question, gravely considering the<br>
answers, and, if you find any part of it especially difficult to<br>
remember, chaining it to the question which will bring it out. Thus,<br>
"What was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede?" "Magna<br>
Charta." "By whom was Magna Charta exacted from King John at Runnymede?"<br>
"By the barons." "From whom was," etc., etc.? "King John." "From what<br>
king," etc., etc.? "King John." "Where was Magna Charta," etc., etc.?<br>
"At Runnymede."<br>
<br>
And so on and so on, as long as your ingenuity can suggest questions to<br>
ask, or points of view from which to consider the statement. Your mind<br>
will be finally saturated with the information, and prepared to spill it<br>
out at the first squeeze of the examiner. This, however, is not new. It<br>
was taught in the schools hundreds of years before Loisette was born.<br>
Old newspaper men will recall in connection with it Horace Greeley's<br>
statement that the test of a news item was the clear and satisfactory<br>
manner in which a report answered the interrogatories, "What?" "When?"<br>
"Where?" "Who?" "Why?"<br>
<br>
In the same way Loisette advises the learning of poetry, e. g.:<br>
<br>
"The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold."<br>
<br>
"Who came down?"<br>
<br>
"How did the Assyian come down?"<br>
<br>
"Like what animal did?" etc.<br>
<br>
And so on and so on, until the verses are exhausted of every scrap of<br>
information to be had out of them by the most assiduous<br>
cross-examination.<br>
<br>
Whatever the reader may think of the availability or value of this part<br>
of the system, there are so many easily applicable tests of the worth of<br>
much that Loisette has done, that it may be taken with the rest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Few people, to give an easy example, can remember the value of the ratio<br>
between the circumference and the diameter of the circle beyond four<br>
places of decimals, or at most six--3.141592. Here is the value to 108<br>
decimal places:<br>
<br>
3.14159265.3589793238.4626433832.7950288419.7169399375.1058209749.-<br>
4459230781.6406286208.9986280348.2534211706.7982148086 plus.<br>
<br>
By a very simple application of the numerical letter values these 108<br>
decimal places can be carried in the mind and recalled about as fast as<br>
you can write them down. All that is to be done is to memorize these<br>
nonsense lines:<br>
<br>
Mother Day will buy any shawl.<br>
My love pick up my new muff.<br>
A Russian jeer may move a woman.<br>
Cables enough for Utopia.<br>
Get a cheap ham pie by my cooley.<br>
The slave knows a bigger ape.<br>
I rarely hop on my sick foot.<br>
Cheer a sage in a fashion safe.<br>
A baby fish now views my wharf.<br>
Annually Mary Ann did kiss a jay,<br>
A cabby found a rough savage.<br>
<br>
Now translate each significant into its proper value and you have the<br>
task accomplished. "Mother Day," m--3, th--l, r--4, d--l, and so on.<br>
Learn the lines one at a time by the method of interrogatories. "Who<br>
will buy any shawl?" "Which Mrs. Day will buy a shawl?" "Is Mother Day<br>
particular about the sort of shawl she will buy?" "Has she bought a<br>
shawl?" etc., etc. Then cement the end of each line to the beginning of<br>
the next one, thus, "Shawl"--"warm garment"--"warmth"--"love"--"my<br>
love," and go on as before. Stupid as the work may seem to you, you can<br>
memorize the figures in fifteen minutes this way so that you will not<br>
forget them in fifteen years. Similarly you can take Haydn's Dictionary<br>
of Dates and turn fact after fact into nonsense lines like these which<br>
you cannot lose.<br>
<br>
And this ought to be enough to show anybody the whole art. If you look<br>
back across the sands of time and find out that it is that ridiculous<br>
old "Thirty days hath September" which comes to you when you are trying<br>
to think of the length of October--if you can quote your old prosody,<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "O datur ambiguis," etc.,<br>
<br>
with much more certainty than you can serve up your Horace; if, in fine,<br>
jingles and alliterations, wise and otherwise, have stayed with you,<br>
while solid and serviceable information has faded away, you may be<br>
certain that here is the key to the enigma of memory.<br>
<br>
You can apply it yourself in a hundred ways. If you wish to clinch in<br>
your mind the fact that Mr. Love lives at 485 Dearborn Street, what is<br>
more easy than to turn 485 into the word "rifle" and chain the ideas<br>
together, say thus: "Love--happiness--good time--<br>
picnic--forest--wood--rangers--range--rifle range--rifle fine<br>
weapon--costly weapon--dearly bought--Dearborn."<br>
<br>
Or if you wish to remember Mr. Bowman's name and you notice he has a<br>
mole on his face which is apt to attract your attention when you next<br>
see him, cement the ideas thus:<br>
<br>
"Mole, mark, target, archer, Bowman."<br>

Short Grammar.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Three little words you often see<br>
&nbsp; Are Articles, a, an, and the.<br>
&nbsp; A Noun's the name of any thing,<br>
&nbsp; As school, or garden, hoop, or swing.<br>
&nbsp; Adjectives tell the kind of noun,<br>
&nbsp; As great, small, pretty, white, or brown.<br>
&nbsp; Instead of Nouns the Pronouns stand--<br>
&nbsp; His head, her face, your arm, my hand.<br>
&nbsp; Verbs tell something to be done--<br>
&nbsp; To read, count, laugh, sing, jump or run.<br>
&nbsp; How things are done the Adverbs tell--<br>
&nbsp; As slowly, quickly, ill or well.<br>
&nbsp; Conjunctions join the words together--<br>
&nbsp; As men and women, wind or weather.<br>
&nbsp; The Preposition stands before<br>
&nbsp; The noun, as in or through the door.<br>
&nbsp; The Interjection shows surprise--<br>
&nbsp; As Oh! how pretty, Ah! how wise.<br>
&nbsp; The whole are called nine parts of speech,<br>
&nbsp; Which reading, writing, speaking teach.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">APPALLING DEPTHS OF SPACE.</span><br>
Distances that Stun the Mind and Baffle Comprehension.<br>
<br>
"The stars," though appearing small to us because of their immense<br>
distance, are in reality great and shining suns. If we were to escape<br>
from the earth into space, the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and eventually the<br>
sun would become invisible. Mizar, the middle star in the tail of the<br>
Great Bear, is forty times as heavy as the sun. To the naked eye there<br>
are five or six thousand of these heavenly bodies visible.<br>
<br>
Cygni is the nearest star to us in this part of the sky. Alpha Centauri,<br>
in the constellation of Centaur, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the<br>
nearest of all the stars. The sun is off 93,000,000 miles; multiply this<br>
by 200,000, and the result is, roughly speaking, 20,000,000,000,000; and<br>
this is the distance we are from Alpha Centauri. At the speed of an<br>
electric current, 180,000 miles per second, a message to be sent from a<br>
point on the earth's surface would go seven times around the earth in<br>
one second. Let it be supposed that messages were sent off to the<br>
different heavenly bodies. To reach the moon at this rate it would take<br>
about one second. In eight minutes a message would get to the sun, and<br>
allowing for a couple of minutes' delay, one could send a message to the<br>
sun and get an answer all within twenty minutes. But to reach Alpha<br>
Centauri it would take three years; and as this is the nearest of the<br>
stars, what time must it take to get to the others? If, when Wellington<br>
won the battle of Waterloo, in 1815, the news had been telegraphed off<br>
immediately, there are some stars so remote that it would not yet have<br>
reached them. To go a step further, if in 1066 the result of the Norman<br>
Conquest had been wired to some of these stars, the message would still<br>
be on its way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SENATOR VEST'S EULOGY ON THE DOG.</span><br>
<br>
"Gentlemen of the Jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn<br>
against him and become his enemy. His son and daughter that he has<br>
reared with loving care may become ungrateful. Those who are nearest and<br>
dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name,<br>
may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he may<br>
lose. It flies away from him when he may need it most. Man's reputation<br>
may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who<br>
are prone to fall on their knees and do us honor when success is with us<br>
may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its<br>
cloud upon our head. The one absolutely unselfish friend a man may have<br>
in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that<br>
never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is the dog.<br>
<br>
"Gentlemen of the jury, A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and<br>
poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground,<br>
when the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may<br>
be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to<br>
offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the<br>
roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if<br>
he were a prince.<br>
<br>
"When all other friends desert, he remains, when riches take wings and<br>
reputation falls to pieces he is as constant in his love as the sun in<br>
its journey through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an<br>
outcast into the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks<br>
no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against<br>
danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all<br>
comes and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid<br>
away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their<br>
way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head<br>
between his paws and his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness,<br>
faithful and true even to death."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HEALTH AND BEAUTY</span><br>
<br>
WOULD YOU BE BEAUTIFUL?<br>
<br>
In womanly beauty the excellences expected and looked for are faultless<br>
symmetry of form and feature and a complexion varying in hue as the mind<br>
is affected by internal emotion, but with an expression of purity,<br>
gentleness, sensibility, refinement and intelligence.<br>
<br>
Moore, the poet, has given expression to his ideal of beauty in the<br>
following lines:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "This was not the beauty--Oh, nothing like this,<br>
&nbsp; That to young Nourmahal gave such magic bliss;<br>
&nbsp; But that loveliness, ever in motion, which plays<br>
&nbsp; Like the light upon autumn's shadowy days.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "Now here and now there, giving warmth as it flies<br>
&nbsp; From the lips to the cheek, from the cheek to the eyes;<br>
&nbsp; Now melting in mist, and now breaking in gleams<br>
&nbsp; Like the glimpses a saint has of heavenly dreams."<br>
<br>
Wordsworth expressed himself in the following lines:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; "He was among the prime in worth,<br>
&nbsp; An object beauteous to behold;<br>
&nbsp; Well born, well bred; I sent him forth<br>
&nbsp; Ingenuous, innocent, and bold."<br>
<br>
Perhaps you ask how you can attain beauty if you do not possess it; or,<br>
if you have some of its qualities, how you may get those you are<br>
lacking. If you will practice the following rules you will grow more and<br>
more beautiful in the eyes of others, even if age does bring gray hair<br>
and a wrinkled skin:<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">CARE OF THE SCALP AND HAIR.</span><br>
<br>
Beautiful hair, beautiful skin and a beautiful form are the three graces<br>
which are the birthright of every woman, but which, through lack of good<br>
judgment and common sense, or through thoughtlessness on the part of<br>
mothers of growing children, comparatively few possess.<br>
<br>
Beautiful hair is one of nature's greatest gifts, and yet we never seem<br>
to appreciate it until there is danger of losing it, or until it becomes<br>
faded and lusterless because we have not used the right means for<br>
preserving it.<br>
<br>
The beauty and continuance of the hair depend upon its proper<br>
nourishment, gained by the circulation of blood through the scalp, and<br>
this must be maintained to keep the hair in good condition.<br>
<br>
The structure of the hair is very beautiful, and each hair is contained<br>
in a delicate sheath which fits into a slight depression in the skin<br>
called the follicle, and around the base of the hair nature has provided<br>
glands to secrete oily matter, the purpose of which is to keep the hair<br>
glossy.<br>
<br>
In early maturity the hair reaches the state of greatest beauty, and at<br>
this time the greatest care should be given it, feeding and nourishing<br>
it as we would a plant--giving it plenty of air and sunlight, carefully<br>
shampooing at least once in ten days. Massage the scalp to keep it loose<br>
and flexible. Use electricity, a good tonic, and occasionally singe the<br>
split ends.<br>
<br>
If this process is commenced at the right time, the result will be fewer<br>
cases of baldness in men and thin, poor hair in women.<br>
<br>
The hair should also be worn loosely, forming a soft frame for the face,<br>
which is always more becoming than tightly drawn hair. Many women drag<br>
their hair out by the roots by tying back too firmly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CARE OF THE SKIN.</span><br>
<br>
A beautiful skin is smooth, soft and clear; the color varies in<br>
different individuals. In perfect health it is moist and with the<br>
delicate shading of a flower--climate, hair and eyes, of course,<br>
determining the color, and the continued beauty of it depending upon<br>
pure blood, fresh air and sunlight, also perfect cleanliness and care.<br>
<br>
The pores should always be kept free from obstruction and extremes of<br>
heat and cold avoided as much as possible. In health, the care of the<br>
skin is a simple matter, massage being a great factor, assisted always<br>
by the use of pure creams. A good cleansing cream is a great necessity,<br>
as it enters the pores and frees them from dirt, leaving the skin soft<br>
and pliable, in which condition it is ready to absorb the skin food when<br>
the finger massage is given, making it possible for the gentle electric<br>
current to force the ointment into the deeper layers of the skin, thus<br>
effecting the removal of moth patches, tan, freckles and other<br>
discolorations and imperfections. The vibratory massage should follow,<br>
the purpose of which is to stimulate the tissues, throwing off worn-out<br>
particles and increasing the circulation of the blood by giving proper<br>
exercise to the facial muscles, thereby restoring and preserving the<br>
color and contour, making the skin beautiful, clear, eradicating and<br>
preventing wrinkles.<br>
<br>
The use of a pure face powder is absolutely necessary. Best results are<br>
obtained by using a blended powder, as the skin tint is thus assured.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TO DEVELOP THE BUST.</span><br>
<br>
A beautiful bust is the desire and admiration of every woman. If nature<br>
has not been kind in this respect, any woman can develop a beautiful<br>
bust by exercise, bathing and gentle massage with a good bust ointment<br>
or skin food.<br>
<br>
Electric massage is very beneficial, and if properly given, brings quick<br>
and sure results.<br>
<br>
Swimming and deep breathing are great aids.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CARE OF THE HANDS.</span><br>
<br>
A study of the hand is very interesting, and if mothers understood more<br>
of its beautiful construction many of the little accidents which result<br>
in deformed finger nails could be avoided. Mothers should attend most<br>
carefully to the early cultivation of their children's finger nails, as<br>
the habit of biting them is so easily formed and is sure to permanently<br>
destroy their beauty.<br>
<br>
A perfect hand is rounded and plump, soft, white and dimpled, with<br>
tapering finger tips and filbert-shaped nails, snowing the little<br>
half-moon.<br>
<br>
It is possible for any woman to have such a hand if she is willing to<br>
take time once a week to have the nails treated and to give them a<br>
little personal attention each day. Great care should be taken in<br>
washing the hands. A mild soap should be used, and particular attention<br>
paid to the thorough drying of them, after which a good cuticle cream<br>
should be applied and well rubbed in. The same cream may be used to<br>
loosen the cuticle at the base of the nail, when it can be gently pushed<br>
back, thus keeping the half-moon exposed. An orange-wood stick should<br>
always be used to clean the nails.<br>
<br>
Massaging the hands at least once a month aids wonderfully in making<br>
them symmetrical and keeping the joints flexible and the skin free from<br>
dark spots and wrinkles.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT.</span><br>
<br>
It is of prime importance in feeding an infant to do this at regular<br>
intervals, since during the first three months of its life the feeding<br>
habits of the child should be established, and if care be used in this<br>
regard the child will wake of its own accord at the proper time. The<br>
last meal at night should be at 11 p. m., and if the child is healthy<br>
and will sleep it need not be fed until 3 to 5 a. m. the following<br>
morning. In both breast and artificial feeding the above applies, and<br>
the same method should be employed; namely, the child should be held in<br>
the arms during the meal, which should last from ten to fifteen minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Both in breast and artificial feeding it is possible to overfeed the<br>
child. Many infants are systematically overfed. The young mother should<br>
understand how small an infant's stomach is. At birth it will hold a<br>
little more than an ounce of fluid, or two tablespoonfuls, and at the<br>
end of two months only three ounces. If, therefore, the mother persists<br>
in trying to give the child four ounces of food, the child will suffer<br>
from an excess. Many children during the first few mouths of life bring<br>
up their food, and the mother fears that there is some inherited<br>
tendency to weak digestion. It is wrong to feed a child simply because<br>
it cries, as very frequently it is not a cry of hunger, but one caused<br>
by indigestion from overfeeding.<br>
<br>
If the child is being fed with the bottle it is important that the food<br>
be given at a temperature of 100 deg. F., or as nearly that as possible;<br>
never over; and if the child be fed out of doors in its carriage it is<br>
well to have a flannel bag of some kind to slip over the bottle to keep<br>
it at the same temperature until the meal is finished. Many cases of<br>
colic are caused by inattention to this point.<br>
<br>
It is a common mistake that when a child cries it needs additional food.<br>
There are many cases where a little drink of water is the prime need of<br>
the child, and great care should be taken that this is heated to the<br>
proper temperature, and especially that no water be given to the child<br>
except that which has been boiled. A few teaspoonfuls should be given to<br>
the child, therefore, several times a day, but aside from that he should<br>
have nothing but his regular food until he is at least a year old. For<br>
the same reason, therefore, if a child be fed by the bottle, the water<br>
used in preparing the food should have been previously boiled, and care<br>
should be exercised not to expose the food to the air during or after<br>
its preparation. It should be remembered that the food of a child must<br>
be nutritious, and that in this food, especially when at the proper<br>
temperature for the infant, bacteria from the air will flourish<br>
wonderfully fast, and therefore the food should not be exposed to<br>
possible contamination.<br>
<br>
It is of very great importance that the feeding-bottles be always clean<br>
and sweet. It is an advantage to have several bottles on hand, and also<br>
two or three brushes for cleaning. Keep a special vessel, with water in<br>
which there is a little bicarbonate of soda, so that the moment the<br>
bottle is used it may be thoroughly washed and kept in the water. Do not<br>
use a nipple with a rubber tube, but the short, black rubber nipples,<br>
which fit over the mouth of the bottle. Do not enlarge the hole in the<br>
nipple, so as to make it too easy for the baby to draw its food,<br>
otherwise the food being taken so rapidly into the stomach will often<br>
cause pain or vomiting. In washing the nipples turn them inside out and<br>
see that they are as thoroughly cleaned as possible, and keep them for<br>
use in a bottle filled with boiled water with a pinch of boric acid<br>
added.<br>
<br>
<br>
The First Nursing.<br>
<br>
It is very important that the child should be put to the breast<br>
immediately after it is washed. This is very necessary, both for the<br>
mother and the child, and prevents subsequent troubles. The fluid<br>
contained in the breast is at this stage called colostrum, and is<br>
intended by Nature to act upon the child as a laxative. This first<br>
nursing stimulates the secretion of the milk and causes uterine<br>
contraction, which is very much needed at this time. It is well to wash<br>
the infant's mouth out with sterilized water every time it feeds. For<br>
this purpose use clean water which has been boiled and allowed to cool,<br>
or a solution of boric acid in boiled water--5 grains to the ounce of<br>
water.<br>
<br>
Infants, as a rule, should be bathed once a day, but never immediately<br>
after being nursed or fed. In very warm weather a child may be sponged<br>
in the evening as well as in the morning. The water for the bath of a<br>
young baby should be warm, and the temperature can be judged by testing<br>
it with the elbow, which is more sensitive than the hand. Lay a small<br>
blanket on the lap, cover the child with a flannel and sponge it under<br>
the clothes. This prevents it from taking cold from exposure, The room<br>
should not be cooler than 68 deg. F., and the door must be kept closed<br>
to avoid drafts. Use only pure white soap, and a soft cloth is better<br>
than a sponge. The body should be carefully dried and lightly powdered<br>
to absorb any moisture that may remain.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NAMES OF THE MONTHS.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DERIVATIONS OF THE NAMES OF THE
MONTHS.</span><br>
<br>
January.--The Roman god Janus presided over the beginning of everything;<br>
hence the first month of the year was called after him.<br>
<br>
February.--The Roman festival Februs was held on the 15th day of this<br>
month, in honor of Lupercus, the god of fertility.<br>
<br>
March--Named from the Roman god of war, Mars.<br>
<br>
April.--Latin, Aprilis, probably derived from aperire, to open; because<br>
spring generally begins, and the buds open in this month.<br>
<br>
May.--Lat. Maius, probably derived from Maia, a feminine divinity<br>
worshiped at Rome on the first day of this month.<br>
<br>
June.--Juno, a Roman divinity worshiped as the Queen of Heaven.<br>
<br>
July (Julius)--Julius Caesar was born in this month.<br>

Roman year. About the 21st of this month the sun enters the Tropic of<br>
Capricorn, and forms the winter solstice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DAYS OF THE WEEK.</span><br>
<br>
Sunday, (Saxon) Sunnandaed, day of the sun,<br>
<br>
Monday, (German) Montag, day or the moon.<br>
<br>
Tuesday, (Anglo-Saxon) Tiwesdaeg, from Tiw, the god of war.<br>
<br>
Wednesday, (Anglo-Saxon) Wodnesdaeg, from Odin, the god of storms.<br>
<br>
Thursday, (Danish) Thor, the god of thunder.<br>
<br>
Friday, (Saxon) Frigedaeg, day of Freya, goddess of marriage.<br>
<br>
Saturday, the day of Saturn, the god of time.<br>
<br>
The names of the seven days of the week originated with the Egyptian<br>
astronomers. They gave them the names of the sun, moon, and five<br>
planets, viz.: Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT HOUSEKEEPERS SHOULD REMEMBER.</span><br>
<br>
That cold rain water and soap will remove machine grease from washable<br>
fabrics.<br>
<br>
That fish may be scaled much easier by first dipping them into boiling<br>
water for a minute.<br>
<br>
That fresh meat beginning to sour will sweeten if placed outdoors in the<br>
cool air over night.<br>
<br>
That milk which has changed may be sweetened or rendered fit for use<br>
again by stirring in a little soda.<br>
<br>
That a tablespoonful of turpentine boiled with your white clothes will<br>
greatly aid the whitening process.<br>
<br>
That kerosene will soften boots and shoes that have been hardened by<br>
water and will render them as pliable as new.<br>
<br>
That thoroughly wetting the hair once or twice with a solution of salt<br>
and water will keep it from falling out.<br>
<br>
That salt fish are quickest and best freshened by soaking in sour milk.<br>
<br>
That salt will curdle new milk; hence, in preparing porridge, gravies,<br>
etc., salt should not be added until the dish is prepared.<br>
<br>
That one teaspoonful of ammonia to a teacup of water, applied with a<br>
rag, will clean silver or gold jewelry perfectly.<br>
<br>
That paint stains that are dry and old may be removed from cotton and<br>
woolen goods with chloroform. It is a good plan to first cover the spot<br>
with olive oil or butter.<br>
<br>
That clear boiling water will remove tea stains. Pour the water through<br>
the stain and thus prevent it spreading over the fabric.<br>
<br>
That charcoal is recommended as an absorbent of gases in the milk-room<br>
where foul gases are present. It should be freshly powdered and kept<br>
there continually, especially in hot weather, when unwholesome odors are<br>
most liable to infect the milk.<br>
<br>
That applying kerosene with a rag, when you are about to put your stoves<br>
away for the summer, will prevent them from rusting. Treat your farming<br>
implements in the same way before you lay them aside for the fall.<br>
<br>
That a teaspoonful of borax, put in the last water in which clothes are<br>
rinsed, will whiten them surprisingly. Pound the borax so it will<br>
dissolve easily. This is especially good to remove the yellow that time<br>
gives to white garments that have been laid aside for two or three<br>
years.<br>
<br>
That a good agency for keeping the air of the cellar sweet and wholesome<br>
is whitewash made of good white lime and water only. The addition of<br>
glue or size, or anything of that kind, only furnishes organic matter to<br>
speedily putrefy. The use of lime in whitewash is not only to give a<br>
white color, but it greatly promotes the complete oxidation of effluvia<br>
in the cellar air. Any vapors that contain combined nitrogen in the<br>
unoxidized form contribute powerfully to the development of disease<br>
germs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CHARACTER AS SEEN IN FACES.</span><br>
<br>
Thick lips indicate genius and conservatism. Large dilating nostrils are<br>
a sign of poetic temperament and a sensitive nature. A long forehead<br>
denotes liberality. Arched eyebrows, good ancestry and amiability. A<br>
bold, projecting Roman nose indicates enterprise. Delicate nose, good<br>
nature. A large nose, strength of will and character. An eye that looks<br>
one cheerfully and frankly in the face shows honesty and faithfulness.<br>
Lips slightly curved upward at the ends indicate a fine sense of humor.<br>
Soft round cheeks denote gentleness and affection; dimples in the<br>
cheeks, roguery; in the chin, one who falls easily in love. A broad chin<br>
denotes firmness. Straight lips, firmly closed, resolution. Large ears<br>
denote generosity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BELL TIME ON SHIPBOARD.</span><br>
<br>
Time on shipboard is divided into periods of four hours--from midnight<br>
to midnight--and the lapse of every half hour is marked by one or more<br>
strokes of the bell--from one stroke for the end of the first half hour<br>
to eight strokes or, in nautical language, eight bells, for the end of<br>
the fourth hour. Thus 12:30 a. m. is 1 bell; 1:00 a. m., 2 bells; 1:30<br>
a. m., 3 bells; 2:00 a. m., 4 bells; 2:30 a. m., 5 bells; 3:00 a. m., 6<br>
bells; 3:30 a. m., 7 bells; 4:00 a. m., 8 bells. Then 4:30 a. m. is<br>
indicated by 1 bell; 5:00 a. m., 2 bells, etc.; 8 bells being sounded at<br>
8:00 a. m., 12:00 m., 4:00 p. m., 8:00 p. m. and 12:00 p. m.<br>
<br>
Four to 8:00 p. m. is divided into two "dog watches" called "first dog<br>
watch" and "last dog watch," so as to change the watches daily;<br>
otherwise starboard or port watch would be on deck the same hours day<br>
after day.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">QUEER ANALOGIES IN NATURE.</span><br>
<br>
The cocoanut is, in many respects, like the human skull, although it<br>
closely resembles the skull of the monkey. A sponge may be so held as to<br>
remind one of the unfleshed face of the skeleton, and the meat of an<br>
English walnut is almost the exact representation of the brain. Plums<br>
and black cherries resemble the human eyes; almonds, and some other<br>
nuts, resemble the different varieties of the human nose, and an opened<br>
oyster and its shell are a perfect image of the human ear. The shape of<br>
almost any man's body may be found in the various kinds of mammoth<br>
pumpkins. The open hand may be discerned in the form assumed by<br>
scrub-willows and growing celery. The German turnip and the eggplant<br>
resemble the human heart. There are other striking resemblances between<br>
human organs and certain vegetable forms, The forms of many mechanical<br>
contrivances in common use may be traced back to the patterns furnished<br>
by nature. Thus, the hog suggested the plow; the butterfly, the ordinary<br>
hinge; the toadstool, the umbrella; the duck, the ship; the fungous<br>
growth on trees, the bracket. Anyone desirous of proving the oneness of<br>
the earthly system will find the resemblances in nature a most amusing<br>
study.--Scientific American.<br>

<br>
Luxury.<br>
<br>
Of two cats, one, thinking to be very fine, hunted only humming birds,<br>
and the other hunted only mice. The first had to hunt much longer than<br>
the other, because humming birds were scarce, so that it spent nearly<br>
all its life in getting food, while the other had little trouble to get<br>
all it wanted. "How unfortunate it is," said the first cat, "that I have<br>
formed my liking for what is so hard to get and is so little when I have<br>
it."<br>
<br>
<br>
Fastidiousness.<br>
<br>
A fastidious ox would not drink while standing in the water with his<br>
head turned down stream lest he should soil the water with his feet. But<br>
once when drinking with his head turned up stream he saw a whole drove<br>
of hogs washing in the water above him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Attracting Attention.<br>
<br>
A flea, which saw many people trying to get the attention of a king and<br>
waiting long for that purpose, said: "Though I am but a little thing, I<br>
will get his attention." So he jumped up the throne until he got on the<br>
king's head. Here he received recognition from the king by a slap, and<br>
when he boasted to a dog of his success, the latter said: "Some get<br>
attention by their merit, others by their demerit. In making yourself a<br>
nuisance you get recognition before the lords of the realm, but only as<br>
a flea."<br>
<br>
<br>
Gambling.<br>
<br>
A monkey playing with a steel trap got his tail cut off. He went back<br>
the next day to get his tail, when he got his foot cut off. "Now," he<br>
said, "I will go back and get both my foot and my tail." He went back,<br>
and the third time he got his head cut off, which ended his monkeying<br>
with the trap.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mugwumpery.<br>
<br>
A mule on one side of a fence was discontented because he was not on the<br>
other side. He finally jumped over, when he was equally discontented<br>
because he was not back again. "Which side of the fence do you want to<br>
be on?" asked a horse. "It does not matter," replied the mule, "provided<br>
I am on the other side."<br>
<br>
<br>
The Non-Partisan.<br>

A dog, running about in an irregular way, was asked where he was going.<br>
"I am not going anywhere," replied the dog, "but only running about to<br>
learn where to go."<br>
<br>
<br>
Partisanship.<br>
<br>
The swans, wishing to drive the peacocks from a park, procured a law<br>
against big feet. The peacocks retaliated by getting a counter law<br>
against big necks. Soon one side could see nothing but ugly feet, and<br>
the other nothing but long necks. At last they came to think peacocks<br>
were all feet and swans all neck.<br>

full amount of the paper.<br>
<br>
Want of consideration--a common defense interposed to the payment of<br>
negotiable paper--is a good defense between the original parties to the<br>
paper; but after it has been transferred before maturity to an innocent<br>
holder for value it is not a defense.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the holder of paper has the right to demand payment before<br>
maturity; for instance, when a draft has been protested for<br>
non-acceptance and the proper notices served, the holder may at once<br>
proceed against the drawer and indorsers.<br>
<br>
Negotiable paper, payable to bearer or indorser in blank, which has been<br>
stolen or lost, cannot be collected by the thief or finder, but a holder<br>
who receives it in good faith before maturity, for value, can hold it<br>
against the owner's claims at the time it was lost.<br>
<br>
If a note or draft is to be paid in the State where it is made, the<br>
contract will be governed by the laws of that State. When negotiable<br>
paper is payable in a State other than that in which it is made, the<br>
laws of that State will govern it. Marriage contracts, if valid where<br>
they are made, are valid everywhere. Contracts relating to personal<br>
property are governed by the laws of the place where made, except those<br>
relating to real estate, which are governed by the laws of the place<br>
where the land is situated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE RIGHT OF DOWER.</span><br>
<br>
Dower is one-third of the husband's estate, and in general cannot be<br>
destroyed by the mere act of the husband. Hence, in the sale of real<br>
estate by the husband, his wife must, with the husband, sign the<br>
conveyance to make the title complete to the purchaser. In the absence<br>
of such signature, the widow can claim full dower rights after the<br>
husband's death. Creditors, also, seize the property subject to such<br>
dower rights.<br>
<br>
The husband in his will sometimes gives his wife property in lieu of<br>
dowry. In this case, she may, after his death, elect to take either such<br>
property or her dower; but she cannot take both. While the husband lives<br>
the wife's right of dower in only inchoate; it cannot be enforced.<br>
Should he sell the land to a stranger, she has no right of action or<br>
remedy until his death.<br>
<br>
In all cases the law of the State in which the land is situated governs<br>
it, and, as in the case of heirship, full information must be sought for<br>
in statute which is applicable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.</span><br>
<br>
Marriage may be entered into by any two persons, with the following<br>
exceptions: Idiots, lunatics, persons of unsound mind, persons related<br>
by blood or affinity within certain degrees prohibited by law, infants<br>
under the age of consent, which varies in the different States, and all<br>
persons already married and not legally divorced.<br>
<br>
The causes for which a divorce may be obtained vary greatly in the<br>
different States. In South Carolina only fraud and force are recognized<br>
as invalidating the marriage tie, this State having no divorce law. In<br>
the District of Columbia and all the other States with the exception of<br>
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia, cruelty is a statutory<br>
cause, and desertion in all but New York. In most of the States neglect<br>
is also recognized as a valid cause. Imprisonment for crime is a cause<br>
in all except Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York.<br>
Physical inability is a cause in all the States except California,<br>
Connecticut, Idaho, North Dakota and Texas. Intemperance, in all but<br>
Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakotah, Rhode Island,<br>
Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The time of residence required to<br>
secure a divorce varies from 6 months in Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada and<br>
Texas to 3 to 5 years in Massachusetts. In most States it is one year.<br>
Remarriage is permitted in all the States having divorce laws except<br>
Georgia, and alimony is also provided for in all these States.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN.</span><br>
<br>
Any and all property which a woman owns at her marriage, together with<br>
rents, issues and profits thereof, and the property which comes to her<br>
by descent, devise, bequest, gift or grant, or which she acquires by her<br>
trade, business, labor, or services performed on her separate account,<br>
shall, notwithstanding her marriage, remain her sole and separate<br>
property, and may be used, collected and invested by her in her own<br>
name, and shall not be subject to the interference or control of her<br>
husband, or be liable for his debts, unless for such debts as may have<br>
been contracted for the support of herself or children by her as his<br>
agent.<br>
<br>
A married woman may likewise bargain, sell, assign, transfer and convey<br>
such property, and enter into contracts regarding the same on her<br>
separate trade, labor or business with the like effect as if she were<br>
unmarried. Her husband, however, is not liable for such contracts, and<br>
they do not render him or his property in any way liable therefor. She<br>
may also sue and be sued in all matters having relation to her sale and<br>
separate property in the same manner as if she were sole.<br>
<br>
In the following cases a married woman's contract may be enforced<br>
against her and her separate estate: 1. When the contract is created in<br>
or respecting the carrying on of the trade or business of the wife. 2.<br>
When it relates to or is made for the sole benefit of her sole or<br>
separate estate. 3. When the intention to charge the separate estate is<br>
expressed in the contract creating the liability.<br>
<br>
When a husband receives a principal sum of money belonging to his wife,<br>
the law presumes he receives it for her use, and he must account for it,<br>
or expend it on her account by her authority or direction, or that she<br>
gave it to him as a gift. If he receives interest or income and spends<br>
it with her knowledge and without objection, a gift will be presumed<br>
from acquiescence.<br>
<br>
Money received by a husband from his wife and expended by him, under her<br>
direction, on his land, in improving the home of the family, is a gift,<br>
and cannot be recovered by the wife, or reclaimed, or an account<br>
demanded.<br>
<br>
An appropriation by a wife, herself, of her separate property to the use<br>
and benefit of her husband, in the absence of all agreement to repay, or<br>
any circumstances from which such an agreement can be inferred, will not<br>
create the relation of debtor and creditor, nor render the husband<br>
liable to account.<br>
<br>
Though no words of gift be spoken, a gift by a wife to her husband may<br>
be shown by the very nature of the transaction, or appear from the<br>
attending circumstances.<br>
<br>
A wife who causelessly deserts her husband is not entitled to the aid of<br>
a court of equity in getting possession of such chattels as she has<br>
contributed to the furnishing and adornment of her husband's house. Her<br>
legal title remains, and she could convey her interest to a third party<br>
by sale, and said party would have a good title, unless her husband<br>
should prove a gift.<br>
<br>
Wife's property is not liable to a lien of a sub-contractor for<br>
materials furnished to the husband for the erection of a building<br>
thereon, where it is not shown that the wife was notified of the<br>
intention to furnish the materials, or a settlement made with the<br>
contractor and given to the wife, her agent or trustee.<br>
<br>
The common law of the United States has some curious provisions<br>
regarding the rights of married women, though in all the States there<br>
are statutory provisions essentially modifying this law. As it now<br>
stands the husband is responsible for necessaries supplied to the wife<br>
even should he not fail to supply them himself, and is held liable if he<br>
turn her from his house, or otherwise separates himself from her without<br>
good cause. He is not held liable if the wife deserts him, or if he<br>
turns her away for good cause. If she leaves him through good cause,<br>
then he is liable. If a man lives with a woman as his wife, and so<br>
represents her, even though this representation is made to one who knows<br>
she is not, he is liable the same way as if she were his wife.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LAW OF FINDING.</span><br>
<br>
The general rule is that the finder has a clear title against every one<br>
but the owner. The proprietor of a hotel or a shop has no right to<br>
demand property of others found on his premises. Such proprietors may<br>
make regulations in regard to lost property which will bind their<br>
employes, but they cannot bind the public. The finder has been held to<br>
stand in the place of the owner, so that he was permitted to prevail in<br>
all action against a person who found an article which the plaintiff had<br>
originally found, but subsequently lost. The police have no special<br>
rights in regard to articles lost, unless those rights are conferred by<br>
statute. Receivers of articles found are trustees for the owner or<br>
finder. They have no power in the absence of special statute to keep an<br>
article against the finder, any more than the finder has to retain an<br>
article against the owner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT.</span><br>
<br>
The new copyright law, which went into effect July 1, 1909, differs in<br>
many respects from the law previously in force. Its main provisions are<br>
given below, but those desiring to avail themselves of its protection<br>
should write to the Register of Copyrights, Library of Congress,<br>
Washington, D. C., for full instructions and the necessary blanks. etc.<br>
The new law provides that the application for registration of any work<br>
"shall specify to which of the following classes the work in which<br>
copyright is claimed belongs": (a) Books, including composite and<br>
cyclopedic works, directories, gazetteers, and other compilations; (b)<br>
periodicals, including newspapers; (c) lectures, sermons, addresses<br>
prepared for oral delivery: (d) dramatic or dramatico-musical<br>
compositions; (c) musical compositions; (f) maps; (g) works of art;<br>
models or designs for works of art; (h) reproductions of a work of art;<br>
(i) drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character:<br>
(j) photographs; (k) prints and pictorial illustrations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Necessary Steps to Secure Copyright.<br>
<br>
For works reproduced in copies for sale: 1. Publish the work with the<br>
copyright notice. The notice may be in the form "Copyright, 19 .....<br>
(year date of publication) by (name of copyright proprietor)." 2.<br>
Promptly after publication, send to the Copyright Office, Library of<br>
Congress, Washington, D. C., two copies of the best edition of the work,<br>
with an application for registration and a money order payable to the<br>
Register of Copyrights for the statutory registration fee of $l.<br>
<br>
In the case of books by American authors, or permanent residents of the<br>
United States, the copies deposited must be accompanied by an affidavit,<br>
under the official seal of an officer authorized to administer oaths,<br>
stating that the typesetting, printing and binding of the book have been<br>
performed within the United States. Affidavit and application forms will<br>
be supplied on request.<br>
<br>
Books of foreign origin in a language or languages other than English<br>
are not required to be manufactured in the United States. In the case of<br>
a book in the English language published abroad before publication in<br>
this country, an ad interim copyright for 30 days may be secured under<br>
certain conditions.<br>
<br>
Copyright may also be had of certain classes of works (see a, b, c,<br>
below) of which copies are not reproduced for sale, by filing an<br>
application for registration, with the statutory fee of $1, sending<br>
therewith: (a) in the case of lectures or other oral addresses or of<br>
dramatic or musical compositions, one complete manuscript or typewritten<br>
copy of the work. Registration, however, does not exempt the copyright<br>
proprietor from the deposit of printed copies. (b) In the case of<br>
photographs not intended for general circulation, one photographic<br>
print. (c) In the case of works of art (paintings, drawings, sculpture),<br>
or of drawings or plastic works of a scientific or technical character,<br>
one photograph or other identifying reproduction of the work. In all<br>
these cases, if the work is later reproduced in copies for sale, such<br>
copies must be deposited.<br>
<br>
<br>
Duration of Copyright.<br>
<br>
The original term of copyright runs for twenty-eight years, and may be<br>
renewed under certain conditions for a further term of twenty-eight<br>
years, making fifty-six years in all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Assignments.<br>
<br>
Copyrights are assignable by any instrument of writing.<br>
<br>
Every assignment of copyright must be recorded in the Copyright Office<br>
within three months after its execution in the United States or within<br>
six months after its execution without the limits of the United States.<br>

<br>
Congress may admit as many new States as desired.<br>
<br>
The Constitution guarantees every citizen a speedy trial by jury.<br>
<br>
A State cannot exercise a power which is vested in Congress alone.<br>
<br>
One State must respect the laws and legal decisions of another.<br>
<br>
Congress cannot pass a law to punish a crime already committed.<br>
<br>
U. S. Senators are chosen by the legislatures of the States by joint<br>
ballot.<br>
<br>
Bills for revenue can originate only in the House of Representatives.<br>
<br>
A person committing a felony in one State cannot find refuge in another.<br>
<br>
The Constitution of the United States forbids excessive bail or cruel<br>
punishment.<br>
<br>
Treaties with foreign countries are made by the President and ratified<br>
by the Senate.<br>
<br>
In the U. S. Senate Rhode Island or Nevada has an equal voice with New<br>
York.<br>
<br>
When Congress passes a bankruptcy law it annuls all the State laws on<br>
that subject.<br>
<br>
Writing alone does not constitute treason against the United States.<br>
There must be an overt act.<br>
<br>
Congress cannot lay any disabilities on the children of a person<br>
convicted of crime or misdemeanor.<br>
<br>
The Territories each send a delegate to Congress, who has the right of<br>
debate, but not the right to vote.<br>
<br>
The Vice-President, who ex-officio presides over the Senate, has no vote<br>
in that body except on a tie ballot.<br>
<br>
An act of Congress cannot become a law over the President's veto except<br>
on a two-thirds vote of both houses.<br>
<br>
An officer of the Government cannot accept title of nobility, order or<br>
honor without the permission of Congress.<br>
<br>
Money lost in the mails cannot be recovered from the Government.<br>
Registering a letter does not insure its contents.<br>
<br>
It is the House of Representatives that may impeach the President for<br>
any crime, and the Senate hears the accusation.<br>
<br>
If the President holds a bill longer than ten days while Congress is<br>
still in session, it becomes a law without his signature.<br>
<br>
Silver coin of denominations less than $1 is not a legal tender for more<br>

It simply decides whether there is good reason to hold for trial. It<br>
consists of twenty-four men, twelve of whom may indict.<br>
<br>
A naturalized citizen cannot become President or Vice-President of the<br>
United States. A male child born abroad of American parents has an equal<br>
chance to become President with one born on American soil.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CHAMOIS SKINS.</span><br>
<br>
The animal from which the chamois skin derives its name inhabits the<br>
high mountains from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus. Chamois are most<br>
numerous in the Alps, where they dwell in small herds and feed on the<br>
herbage of the mountain sides. They are about the size of a small goat,<br>
dark chestnut-brown in color, with the exception of the forehead, the<br>
sides of the lower jaws and the muzzle, which are white. Its horns,<br>
rising above the eyes, are black, smooth and straight for two-thirds of<br>
their length, when they suddenly curve backward.<br>
<br>
The chamois hunter, provided with a gun, a bag of provisions, an<br>
iron-shod staff to assist him in climbing and leaping, an ax to cut<br>
steps in the ice and shoes studded with iron points, traverses the<br>
mountains and follows his prey not only during the day, but also at<br>
night.<br>
<br>
Nearly all the chamois skins now in the market are made from the skins<br>
of the lamb or sheep. This industry has been largely developed in<br>
England and France, and these countries have supplied the market of the<br>
United States almost exclusively until recent years, when the<br>
manufacture of these goods was commenced in the United States.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DICTIONARY OF AERONAUTICS</span><br>
<br>
The new science of aeronautics has given rise to many new words, among<br>
them some of awkward derivation, and even those properly formed and<br>
worthy of preservation in the language are often erroneously used. The<br>
following compact lexicon is therefore both interesting and instructive:<br>
<br>
Aeroplane--A generic term applied in common use to all classes of<br>
sustaining surfaces; strictly applicable only to flat surfaces.<br>
<br>
Adjusting Surfaces--Commonly a comparatively small surface, usually at<br>
the end of a wing tip, used to adjust lateral balance; preferably<br>
restricted to surfaces capable of variable adjustment, but not of<br>
movement by controlling devices. See "Stabilizer'" and "Wing tip" and<br>
compare "Aileron."<br>
<br>
Advancing Edge--The front edge of a sustaining or other surface.<br>
<br>
Advancing Surface--A surface that precedes another through the air, as<br>
in a double monoplane.<br>
<br>
Aerocurve--A proposed substitute for aeroplane.<br>
<br>
Aerodrome--A substitute proposed by Langley for aeroplane. Strictly<br>
applicable to a course rather than to a vehicle.<br>
<br>
Aileron (a'ler-on)--A small hinged or separated wing tip or surface<br>
capable of independent manipulation for the purpose of maintaining<br>
lateral balance.<br>
<br>
Aviation (a-vi-a'shun)--Dynamic flight by means of heavier-than-air<br>
mechanisms.<br>
<br>
Aviator (a'vi-a-ter)--The operator or pilot of a heavier-than-air<br>
machine.<br>
<br>
Aerofoil--Term used to indicate lifting surface,<br>
<br>
Angle of Incidence--The angle which a line drawn from the leading to the<br>
trailing edge of the plane makes with the horizontal trailing angle<br>
between the tangent to the trailing edge of the plane and the chord or a<br>
line drawn from the leading to the trailing edge.<br>
<br>
Arc--Any portion of a circle or other curve.<br>
<br>
Aspect--The top or plan view of an aeroplane surface.<br>
<br>
Automatic Stability--Applied to lateral or longitudinal stability<br>
maintained by the action of suitable elements on mechanisms independent<br>
of any control exercised by the operator. There is a tendency to<br>
restrict the term to such stability secured by automatic manipulation of<br>
controlling devices, rather than to systems in which balance is<br>
maintained by the use of dihedral arrangements.<br>
<br>
Biplane (bi'plane)--An aeroplane with two superposed main surfaces.<br>
<br>
Balance--To maintain equilibrium by hand or automatic movement of<br>
balancing surfaces, as opposed to equilibrium maintained by stabilizing.<br>
See "Stabilizer."<br>
<br>
Body--The center part of an aeroplane or other aerial vehicle, in which<br>
the motor, fuel tanks, passenger accommodation, etc., are placed.<br>
<br>
Camber--The camber of the ribs is the amount of curvature which is<br>
imparted to them in the same way that a motor car spring or a road has a<br>
camber or curvature.<br>
<br>
Chassis (shas-see)--That part of the main framework of a monoplane to<br>
which the main planes and tail planes are fitted and which contains the<br>
engine and aviators seat.<br>
<br>
Center of Pressure--Really a line of pressure along the under side of a<br>
wing or aeroplane surface, on either side of which the pressures are<br>
equal.<br>
<br>
Center of Gravity--The center of weight, about which the vehicle<br>
balances in all directions.<br>
<br>
Chord--A straight line drawn between the ends of the arc of a circle or<br>
other curve.<br>
<br>
Dirigible (dir'-igihle)--Steerable or navigable; applied to balloons.<br>
<br>
Derrick--A tower in which a falling weight is dropped in starting an<br>
aeroplane.<br>
<br>
Diagonal--A diagonal brace or stay in a framework.<br>
<br>
Dihedral (di-he'dral)--Said of wing pairs inclined at an upward angle to<br>
each other.<br>
<br>
Elevator--A principal supplementary surface, usually of a miniature form<br>
of the main planes. Used for purpose of altering the vertical direction<br>
of machine.<br>
<br>
Gap--The distance between two main planes in a biplane.<br>
<br>
Gliding--Flying down a slant of air without power.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE CLAIMS OF OSTEOPATHY.</span><br>
<br>
Strictly construing the claims of osteopathic doctors, it is an<br>
anti-medicine system of practice for the cure of every disease to which<br>
the human body is liable.<br>
<br>
Dr. Andrew T. Still, who claims to have made the discoveries that led to<br>
the establishment of the school of Osteopathy, asserts that all diseases<br>
and lesions are the result of the luxation, dislocation, or breakage of<br>
some bone or bones; this, however, is not now maintained to any great<br>
extent by his followers. Osteopathists, though, do generally claim that<br>
all diseases arise from some maladjustment of the bones of the human<br>
body, and that treatment, therefore, must be to secure the normal<br>
adjustment of the bones and ligaments that form the skeleton. They claim<br>
that a dislocation is not always necessarily the result of external<br>
violence; it may be caused by the ulceration of bones, the elongation of<br>
ligaments, or excessive muscular action.<br>
<br>
The constriction of an important artery or vein, which may be caused by<br>
a very slightly displaced bone, an indurated muscle, or other organ, may<br>
produce an excess of blood in one part of the body, thereby causing a<br>
deficiency in some other part. A dislocated member will generally show<br>
alteration in the form of the joint and axis of the limb; loss of power<br>
and proper motion; increased length or shortening of the limb;<br>
prominence at one point and depression at another; greatly impaired<br>
circulation, and pain due to the obstruction of nerve force in the parts<br>
involved.<br>
<br>
The osteopathist claims that pain and disease arise mainly from some<br>
mal-adjustment in some part of the body, and that a return to good<br>
health involves treatment for the normal adjustment of the skeleton; he<br>
asserts, though any luxation may be only partial, it may cause pressure<br>
at some point upon a blood vessel, or a nerve of which the patient may<br>
be unconscious, and thus be a barrier to the restoration of good health.<br>
<br>
<br>
Osteopathy asserts that trying to heal the body of an ailment caused by<br>
a dislocated member, be it a bone, ligament, or nerve, by which abnormal<br>
pressure is maintained upon a blood vessel or a nerve, would be like<br>
trying to operate a machine with an important cog out of gear. To cure<br>
it involves the reduction of a dislocation; the breaking up of<br>
adhesions, and the arousing of the enervated organ or organs partially<br>
or wholly failing in the performance of function.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LAW OF TRADEMARKS.</span><br>
<br>
Any person, firm or corporation can obtain protection for any lawful<br>
trademark by complying with the following:<br>
<br>
1. By causing to be recorded in the Patent Office the name, residence<br>
and place of business of persons desiring the trademark.<br>
<br>
2. The class of merchandise and description of the same.<br>
<br>
3. A description of the trademark itself with facsimiles.<br>
<br>
4. The length of time that the said mark has already been used.<br>
<br>
5. By payment of the required fee--$6 for labels and $25 for trademarks.<br>
<br>
6. By complying with such regulations as may be prescribed by the<br>
Commissioner of Patents.<br>
<br>
7. A lawful trademark must consist of some arbitrary word (not the name<br>
of a person or place), indicating or not the use or nature of the thing<br>
to which it is applied; of some designating symbol, or of both said word<br>
and symbol.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO OBTAIN A PATENT.</span><br>
<br>
Patents are issued in the name of the United States, and under the seal<br>
of the Patent Office. A patent is a grant by the Government to the<br>
inventor, his heirs or assigns, for a limited period, of the exclusive<br>
right to make, use or sell any new and useful art, machine, manufacture<br>
or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, or<br>
any new, original and ornamental design for any article of manufacture.<br>
<br>
Every patent contains a grant to the patentee, his heirs or assigns, for<br>
the term of seventeen years, of the exclusive right to make, use and<br>
vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States and the<br>
Territories, referring to the specification for the particulars thereof.<br>
<br>
If it appears that the inventor, at the time of making his application,<br>
believed himself to be the first inventor or discoverer, a patent will<br>
not be refused on account of the invention or discovery, or any part<br>
thereof, having been known or used in any foreign country before his<br>
invention or discovery thereof, if it had not been before patented or<br>
described in any printed publication.<br>
<br>
Joint inventors are entitled to a joint patent; neither can claim one<br>
separately. Independent inventors of distinct and independent<br>
improvements in the same machine cannot obtain a joint patent for their<br>
separate inventions; nor does the fact that one furnishes the capital<br>
and another makes the invention entitle them to make application as<br>
joint inventors; but in such case they may become joint patentees.<br>
<br>
Application for a patent must be made in writing to the Commissioner of<br>
Patents, from whom blanks and printed instructions can be obtained by<br>
mail.<br>
<br>
REISSUES.--A reissue is granted to the original patentee, his legal<br>
representatives, or the assignees of the entire interest, when, by<br>
reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason of the<br>
patentee claiming as his invention or discovery more than he had a right<br>
to claim as new, the original patent is inoperative or invalid, provided<br>
the error has arisen from inadvertence, accident or mistake and without<br>
any fraudulent or deceptive intention.<br>
<br>
CAVEATS.--A caveat, under the patent law, is a notice given to the<br>
office of the caveator's claim as inventor, in order to prevent the<br>
grant of a patent to another for the same alleged invention upon an<br>
application filed during the life of the caveat without notice to the<br>
caveator.<br>
<br>
Any citizen of the United States who has made a new invention or<br>
discovery, and desires further time to mature the same, may, on payment<br>
of a fee of $10, file in the Patent Office a caveat setting forth the<br>
object and the distinguishing characteristics of the invention, and<br>
praying protection of his right until he shall have matured his<br>
invention. Such caveat shall be filed in the confidential archives of<br>
the office and preserved in secrecy, and shall be operative for the term<br>
of one year from the filing thereof.<br>
<br>
An alien has the same privilege, if he has resided in the United States<br>
one year next preceding the filing of his caveat, and has made oath of<br>
his intention to become a citizen.<br>
<br>
The caveat must comprise a specification, oath, and, when the nature of<br>
the case admits of it, a drawing, and, like the application, must be<br>
limited to a single invention or improvement.<br>
<br>
FEES.--Fees must be paid in advance, and are as follows. On filing each<br>
original application for a patent, $15. On issuing each original patent,<br>
$20. In design cases: For three years and six months, $10: for seven<br>
years, $15; for fourteen years, $30. On filing each caveat, $10.<br>
<br>
On every application for the reissue of a patent, $30. Added to these<br>
are the usual charges of patent solicitors for preparing the application<br>
and for drawings etc.<br>

(Polonius' Advice to His Son Laertes.)<br>
<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
See thou character: Give thy thoughts no tongue.<br>
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,<br>
Bear 't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy.<br>
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *<br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be:<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all: to thine own self be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO MAKE CHANGE QUICKLY.</span><br>
<br>
Always consider the amount of purchase as if that much money were<br>
already counted out, then add to amount of purchase enough small change<br>
to make an even dollar, counting out the even dollars last until full<br>
amount is made up.<br>
<br>
If the purchase amounts to 57 cents, and you are handed $2.00 in<br>
payment, count out 43 cents first to make an even dollar. Then layout<br>
the other dollar.<br>
<br>
Should the purchase be $3.69, to be taken out of $20.00, begin with<br>
$3.69 as the basis and make up even $4.00 by laying out 31 cents. This<br>
31 cents with the amount of the purchase you will consider as $4.00, and<br>
count out even dollars to make up the $20.00 which the customer has<br>
handed in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MERCHANTS' COST AND PRICE MARKS.</span><br>
<br>
All merchants use private cipher marks to note cost or selling price of<br>
goods. The cipher is usually made up from some short word or sentence of<br>
nine or ten letters, as:<br>

Five dollars, according to this key, would be eaa. But generally an<br>
extra letter is used to prevent repeating the mark for 0. If the sign<br>
for a second 0 in this case were y, we would have eay instead of eaa.<br>

<br>
Wholesale houses usually invoice their goods to retailers at "list"<br>
prices. List prices were once upon a time supposed to be retail prices,<br>
but of late a system of "long" list prices has come into vogue in many<br>
lines of trade--that is, the list price is made exorbitantly high, so<br>
that wholesalers can give enormous discounts. These discounts, whether<br>
large or small, are called trade discounts, and are usually deducted at<br>
a certain rate per cent from the face of invoice.<br>
<br>
The amount of discount generally depends upon size of bill or terms of<br>
settlement, or both. Sometimes two or more discounts are allowed. Thus<br>
30% and 5% is expressed 30 and 5 meaning first a discount of 30% and<br>
then 5% from the remainder.<br>
<br>
30 and 5 is not 35% but 33-1/3%. 10, 5 and 3 off means three successive<br>
discounts.<br>
<br>
A wholesale house allowing 10, 5 and 3 off gets more for its goods than<br>
it would at 18 off.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO DETECT COUNTERFEIT MONEY.</span><br>
<br>
In the space at disposal here, it is impossible of course to give a<br>
complete illustrated counterfeit detector, but the following simple<br>
rules, laid down by Bank Note Examiner Geo. R. Baker, will be found<br>
extremely valuable:<br>
<br>
Examine the form and features of all human figures: if graceful, and<br>
features distinct, examine the drapery. Notice whether the folds lie<br>
naturally, and observe whether the fine strands of the hair are plain<br>
and distinct.<br>
<br>
Examine the lettering. In a genuine bill is absolutely perfect. There<br>
has never been a counterfeit put out but was more or less defective in<br>
the lettering.<br>
<br>
Counterfeiters rarely, if ever, get the imprint or engraver's name<br>
perfect. The shading in the background of the vignette and over and<br>
around the letters forming the name of the bank, on a good bill, is even<br>
and perfect; on a counterfeit, it is uneven and imperfect.<br>
<br>
The die work around the figures of the denomination should be of the<br>
same character as the ornamental work surrounding it.<br>
<br>
Never take a bill deficient in any of these points.<br>
<br>

Big Trees.--Of ninety-two redwood trees in Calaveras Grove, Cal., ten<br>
are over thirty feet in diameter, and eighty-two have a diameter of from<br>
fifteen to thirty feet. Their ages are estimated at from 1,000 to 3,500<br>
years. Their height ranges from 150 to 237 feet.<br>

<br>
A hawk flies 150 miles per hour; an eider duck 90 miles; a pigeon, 40<br>
miles.<br>
<br>
A man's working life is divided into four decades: 20 to 30, bronze; 30<br>
to 40, silver; 40 to 50, gold; 50 to 60, iron. Intellect and judgment<br>
are strongest between 40 and 50.<br>
<br>
Hair which is lightest in color is also lightest in weight. Light or<br>
blond hair is generally the most luxuriant, and it has been calculated<br>
that the average number of hairs of this color on an average person's<br>
head is 140,000; while the number of brown hairs is 110,000, and black<br>
only 103,000.<br>

One woman in 20, one man in 30 is barren--about 4 per cent. It is found<br>
that one marriage in 20 is barren--5 per cent. Among the nobility of<br>
Great Britain, 21 per cent have no children, owing partly to<br>
intermarriage of cousins, no less than 4-1/2 per cent being married to<br>
cousins.<br>

The average of human life is 33 years. One child out of every four dies<br>
before the age of 7 years, and only one-half of the world's population<br>
reach the age of 17. One out of 10,000 reaches 100 years. The average<br>

The degrees of alcohol in wines and liquors are: Beer, 4.0; porter, 4.5;<br>

34.0; Chartreuse, 43.0; gin, 51.6; brandy, 53.4; rum, 53.7; Irish<br>
whisky, 53.9; Scotch, 54.3. Spirits are said to be "proof" when they<br>
contain 57 per cent. The maximum amount of alcohol, says Parkes, that a<br>
man can take daily without injury to his health is that contained in 2<br>
oz. Brandy, 1/4 pt. of sherry, 1/2 pt. of claret, or 1 pt. of beer.<br>

The measurement of that part of the skull which holds the brain is<br>
stated in cubic inches thus: Anglo-Saxon, 105; German, 105; negro, 96;<br>
ancient Egyptian, 93; Hottentot, 58; Australian native, 58. In all races<br>
the male brain is about ten per cent heavier than the female. The<br>
highest class of apes has only 16 oz. of brain. A man's brain, it is<br>
estimated, consists of 300,000,000 nerve cells, of which over 3,000 are<br>
disintegrated and destroyed every minute. Everyone, therefore, has a new<br>
brain once in sixty days. But excessive labor, or lack of sleep,<br>
prevents the repair of the tissues, and the brain gradually wastes away.<br>
Diversity of occupation, by calling upon different portions of the mind<br>
or body successively, affords, in some measure, the requisite repose to<br>
each. But in this age of overwork there is no safety except in that<br>
perfect rest which is the only natural restorative of exhausted power.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE RULE OF THE ROAD.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The "rule of the road" in the United States is "turn to the right"; in<br>
England it is the reverse. The rule holds in this country in the case<br>
where two vehicles going in opposite directions meet. When one vehicle<br>
overtakes another the foremost gives way to the left and the other<br>
passes by on the "off side"; and when a vehicle is crossing the<br>
direction of another it keeps to the left and crosses in its rear. These<br>
two rules are the same in this country as in England, and why the rule<br>
concerning meeting vehicles should have been changed it is impossible to<br>
say.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">CANARY BIRDS.</span><br>
<br>
How to Keep Them Healthy and in Good Song.<br>
<br>
Place the cage so that no draught of air can strike the bird.<br>
<br>
Give nothing to healthy birds but rape, hemp, canary seed, water,<br>
cuttle-fish bone, and gravel, paper or sand on floor of cage.<br>
<br>
A bath three times a week;<br>
<br>
The room should not be overheated.<br>
<br>
When moulting keep warm and avoid all draughts of air.<br>
<br>
Give plenty of German summer rape seed. A little hard-boiled egg mixed<br>
with cracker, grated fine, once or twice a week, is excellent.<br>
<br>
Feed at a certain hour in the morning.<br>
<br>
<br>
Diseases and Cures.<br>
<br>
Husk or Asthma.--The curatives are aperients, such as endive, water<br>
cresses, bread and milk, and red pepper.<br>
<br>
Pip.--Mix red pepper, butter and garlic and swab out the throat.<br>
<br>
Sweating.--Wash the hen in salt and water, and dry rapidly.<br>
<br>
Costiveness.--Plenty of green food and fruit.<br>
<br>
Obstruction of the Rump Gland--Pierce with a needle. Press the inflamed<br>
matter out, and drop fine sugar over the wound.<br>
<br>
Lice.--Keep a saucer of fresh water in the cage and the bird will free<br>
itself.<br>
<br>
Overgrown Claws or Beak.--Pare carefully with a sharp knife.<br>
<br>
Moulting.--Give plenty of good food and keep warm. Saffron and a rusty<br>
nail put in the drinking water is excellent.<br>
<br>
Loss of Voice.--Feed with paste of bread, lettuce and rape seed with<br>
yoke of egg. Whisky and sugar is an excellent remedy.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPES, TRADE SECRETS ETC.</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toothache Cure.</span>--Compound
tinct. benzoin is said to be one of the most<br>
certain and speedy cures for toothache; pour a few drops on cotton, and<br>
press at once into the diseased cavity, when the pain will almost<br>
instantly cease.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Toothache Tincture.</span>--Mix
tannin, 1 scruple; mastic, 3 grains; ether, 2<br>
drams. Apply on cotton wool, to the tooth, previously dried.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charcoal Tooth Paste</span>.--Chlorate
of potash, 1/2 dram; mint water, 1<br>
ounce. Dissolve and add powdered charcoal, 2 ounces; honey, 1 ounce.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excellent Mouth Wash.</span>--Powdered
white Castile soap, 2 drams; alcohol, 3<br>
ounces; honey, 1 ounce; essence or extract jasmine, 2 drams. Dissolve<br>
the soap in alcohol and add honey and extract.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Removing Tartar from the Teeth.</span>--This
preparation is used by dentists.<br>
Pure muriatic acid, one ounce; water, one ounce; honey, two ounces; mix<br>
thoroughly. Take a toothbrush, and wet it freely with this preparation,<br>
and briskly rub the black teeth, and in a moment's time they will be<br>
perfectly white; then immediately wash out the mouth well with water,<br>
that the acid may not act on the enamel of the teeth. This should be<br>
done only occasionally.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test for Glue.</span>--The following
simple and easy test for glue is given: A<br>
weighed piece of glue (say one-third of an ounce) is suspended in water<br>
for twenty-four hours, the temperature of which is not above fifty<br>
degrees Fahrenheit. The coloring material sinks, and the glue swells<br>
from the absorption of the water. The glue is then taken out and<br>
weighed; the greater the increase in weight the better the glue. If it<br>
then be dried perfectly and weighed again, the weight of the coloring<br>
matter can be learned from the difference between this and the original<br>
weight.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bad Breath.</span>--Bad breath from
catarrh, foul stomach or bad teeth may be<br>
temporarily relieved by diluting a little bromo chloralum with eight or<br>
ten parts of water, and using it as a gargle, and swallowing a few drops<br>
before going out. A pint of bromo chloralum costs fifty cents, but a<br>
small vial will last a long time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Good Tooth Powder.</span>--Procure, at
a druggist's, half an ounce of powdered<br>
orris root, half an ounce of prepared chalk finely pulverized, and two<br>
or three small lumps of Dutch pink. Let them all be mixed in a mortar,<br>
and pounded together. The Dutch pink is to impart a pale reddish color.<br>
Keep it in a close box.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Another Tooth Powder.</span>--Mix
together, in a mortar, half an ounce of red<br>
Peruvian bark, finely powdered, a quarter of an ounce of powdered myrrh,<br>
and a quarter of an ounce of prepared chalk.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Safe Depilatory.</span>--Take a
strong solution of sulphuret of barium, and<br>
add enough finely powdered starch to make a paste. Apply to the roots of<br>
the hair and allow it to remain on a few minutes, then scrape off with<br>
the back edge of a knife blade, and rub with sweet oil.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quick Depilatory for Removing Hair.</span>--Best
slaked lime, 6 ounces;<br>
orpiment, fine powder, 1 ounce. Mix with a covered sieve and preserve in<br>
a dry place in closely stoppered bottles. In using mix the powder with<br>
enough water to form a paste, and apply to the hair to be removed. In<br>
about five minutes, or as soon as its caustic action is felt on the<br>
skin, remove, as in shaving, with an ivory or bone paper knife, wash<br>
with cold water freely, and apply cold cream.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tricopherus for the Hair.</span>--Castor
oil, alcohol, each 1 pint; tinct.<br>
cantharides, 1 ounce; oil bergamot, 1/2 ounce; alkanet coloring, to<br>
color as wished. Mix and let it stand forty-eight hours, with occasional<br>
shaking, and then filter.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Liquid Shampoo.-</span>-Take bay rum.
2-1/2 pints; water, 1/2 pint; glycerine,<br>
1 ounce; tinct. cantharides, 2 drams; carbonate of ammonia, 2 drams;<br>
borax, 1/2 ounce; or take of New England rum, 1-1/2 pints; bay rum, 1<br>
pint; water, 1/2 pint; glycerine, 1 ounce; tinct. cantharides, 2 drams,<br>
ammon. carbonate, 2 drams; borax, 1/2 ounce; the salts to be dissolved<br>
in water and the other ingredients to be added gradually.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cleaning Hair Brushes.</span>--Put a
teaspoonful or dessertspoonful of aqua<br>
ammonia into a basin half full of water, comb the loose hairs out of the<br>
brush, then agitate the water briskly with the brush, and rinse it well<br>
with clear water.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hair Invigorator.</span>--Bay rum, two
pints; alcohol, one pint; castor oil,<br>
one ounce; carb. ammonia, half an ounce; tincture of cantharides, one<br>
ounce. Mix them well. This compound will promote the growth of the hair<br>
and prevent it from falling out.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Dandruff.</span>--Take glycerine,
four ounces; tincture of cantharides,<br>
five ounces; bay rum, four ounces; water, two ounces. Mix and apply once<br>
a day, and rub well into the scalp.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mustache Grower</span>.--Simple
cerate, 1 ounce; oil bergamot, 10 minims;<br>
saturated tinct. of cantharides, 15 minims. Rub them together<br>
thoroughly, or melt the cerate and stir in the tincture while hot, and<br>
the oil as soon as it is nearly cold, then run into molds or rolls. To<br>
be applied as a pomade, rubbing in at the roots of the hair. Care must<br>
be used not to inflame the skin by too frequent application.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Razor-strop Paste.</span>--Wet the
strop with a little sweet oil, and apply a<br>
little flour of emery evenly over the surface.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shaving Compound.</span>--Half a pound
of plain white soap, dissolved in a<br>
small quantity of alcohol, as little as can be used; add a tablespoonful<br>
of pulverized borax. Shave the soap and put it in a small tin basin or<br>
cup; place it on the fire in a dish of boiling water; when melted, add<br>
the alcohol, and remove from the fire; stir in oil of bergamot<br>
sufficient to perfume it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cure for Prickly Heat.</span>--Mix a
large portion of wheat bran with either<br>
cold or lukewarm water, and use it as a bath twice or thrice a day.<br>
Children who are covered with prickly heat in warm weather will be thus<br>
effectually relieved from that tormenting eruption. As soon as it begins<br>
to appear on the neck, face or arms, commence using the bran water on<br>
these parts repeatedly through the day, and it may probably spread no<br>
farther. If it does, the bran water bath will certainly cure it, if<br>
persisted in.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Corns from Between the Toes.</span>--These
corns are generally more<br>
painful than any others, and are frequently situated as to be almost<br>
inaccessible to the usual remedies. Wetting them several times a day<br>
with hartshorn will in most cases cure them. Try it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Superior Cologne Water.</span>--Oil of
lavender, two drams; oil of rosemary,<br>
one dram and a half; orange, lemon and bergamot, one dram each of the<br>
oil; also two drams of the essence of musk, attar of rose, ten drops,<br>
and a pint of proof spirit. Shake all together thoroughly three times a<br>
day for a week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inexhaustible Smelling Salts.</span>--Sal
tartar, three drams; muriate ammonia,<br>
granulated, 6 drams; oil neroli. 5 minims; oil lavender flowers, 5<br>
minims; oil rose, 3 minims; spirits ammonia, 15 minims. Put into the<br>
pungent a small piece of sponge filling about one-fourth the space, and<br>
pour on it a due proportion of the oils, then put in the mixed salts<br>
until the bottle is three-fourths full, and pour on the spirits of<br>
ammonia in proper proportion and close the bottle.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Volatile Salts for Pungents.</span>--Liquor
ammon., 1 pint; oil lavender<br>
flowers, 1 dram; oil rosemary, fine, 1 dram; oil bergamot, 1/2 dram; oil<br>
peppermint, 10 minims. Mix thoroughly and fill pungents or keep in well<br>
stoppered bottle. Another formula is, sesqui-carbonate of ammonia,<br>
small pieces, 10 ounces; concentrated liq. ammonia, 5 ounces. Put the<br>
sesqui-carb. in a wide-mouthed jar with air-tight stopper, perfume the<br>
liquor ammonia to suit and pour over the carbonate; close tightly the<br>
lid and place in a cool place; stir with a stiff spatula every other day<br>
for a week, and then keep it closed for two weeks, or until it becomes<br>
hard, when it is ready for use.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paste for Papering Boxes.</span>--Boil
water and stir in batter of wheat or rye<br>
flour. Let it boil one minute, take off and strain through a colander.<br>
Add, while boiling, a little glue or powdered alum. Do plenty of<br>
stirring while the paste is cooking, and make of consistency that will<br>
spread nicely.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aromatic Spirit of Vinegar.</span>--Acetic
acid, No. 8. pure, 8 ounces;<br>
camphor, 1/2 ounce. Dissolve and add oil lemon, oil lavender flowers,<br>
each two drams; oil cassia, oil cloves, 1/2 dram each. Thoroughly mix<br>
and keep in well stoppered bottle.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rose-Water.</span>--Preferable to the
distilled for a perfume, or for ordinary<br>
purposes. Attar of rose, twelve drops; rub it up with half an ounce of<br>
white sugar and two drams carbonate magnesia, then add gradually one<br>
quart of water and two ounces of proof spirit, and filter through paper.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bay Rum.</span>--French proof spirit,
one gallon; extract bay, six ounces. Mix<br>
and color with caramel; needs no filtering.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fine Lavender Water.</span>--Mix
together, in a clean bottle, a pint of<br>
inodorous spirit of wine, an ounce of oil of lavender, a teaspoonful of<br>
oil of bergamot, and a tablespoonful of oil of ambergris.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Virtues of Turpentine.</span>--After
a housekeeper fully realizes the worth<br>
of turpentine in the household, she is never willing to be without a<br>
supply of it. It gives quick relief to burns, it is an excellent<br>
application for corns, it is good for rheumatism and sore throat, and it<br>
is the quickest remedy for convulsions or fits. Then it is a sure<br>
preventive against moths: by just dropping a trifle in the bottom of<br>
drawers, chests and cupboards, it will render the garments secure from<br>
injury during the summer. It will keep ants and bugs from closets and<br>
store-rooms by putting a few drops in the corners and upon the shelves;<br>
it is sure destruction to bedbugs, and will effectually drive them away<br>
from their haunts if thoroughly applied to all the joints of the<br>
bedstead in the spring cleaning time, and injures neither furniture nor<br>
clothing. A spoonful of it added to a pail of warm water is excellent<br>
for cleaning paint. A little in suds washing days lightens laundry<br>
labor.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Perpetual Paste </span>is a paste
that may be made by dissolving an ounce of<br>
alum in a quart of warm water. When cold, add as much flour as will make<br>
it the consistency of cream, then stir into it half a teaspoonful of<br>
powdered resin, and two or three cloves. Boil it to a consistency of<br>
mush, stirring all the time. It will keep for twelve months, and when<br>
dry may be softened with warm water.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paste for Scrap Books.</span>--Take
half a teaspoonful of starch, same of<br>
flour, pour on a little boiling water, let it stand a minute, add more<br>
water, stir and cook it until it is thick enough to starch a shirt<br>
bosom. It spreads smooth, sticks well and will not mold or discolor<br>
paper. Starch alone will make a very good paste.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Strong Paste.</span>--A paste that
will neither decay nor become moldy. Mix<br>
good clean flour with cold water into a thick paste well blended<br>
together; then add boiling water, stirring well up until it is of a<br>
consistency that can be easily and smoothly spread with a brush; add to<br>
this a spoonful or two of brown sugar, a little corrosive sublimate and<br>
about half a dozen drops of oil of lavender, and you will have a paste<br>
that will hold with wonderful tenacity.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Brilliant Paste.</span>--A brilliant
and adhesive paste, adapted to fancy<br>
articles, may be made by dissolving caseine precipitated from milk by<br>
acetic acid and washed with pure water in a saturated solution of borax.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Sugar Paste.</span>--In order to
prevent the gum from cracking, to ten parts<br>
by weight of gum arabic and three parts of sugar add water until the<br>
desired consistency is obtained. If a very strong paste is required, add<br>
a quantity of flour equal in weight to the gum, without boiling the<br>
mixture. The paste improves in strength when it begins to ferment.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tin Box Cement.</span>--To fix labels
to tin boxes either of the following will<br>
answer: 1. Soften good glue in water, then boil it in strong vinegar,<br>
and thicken the liquid while boiling with fine wheat flour, so that a<br>
paste results. 2. Starch paste, with which a little Venice turpentine<br>
has been incorporated while warm.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper and Leather Paste.</span>--Cover
four parts, by weight, of glue, with<br>
fifteen parts of cold water, and allow it to soak for several hours,<br>
then warm moderately till the solution is perfectly clear, and dilute<br>
with sixty parts of boiling water, intimately stirred in. Next prepare a<br>
solution of thirty parts of starch in two hundred parts of cold water,<br>
so as to form a thin homogeneous liquid, free from lumps, and pour the<br>
boiling glue solution into it with thorough stirring, and at the same<br>
time keep the mass boiling.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Commercial Mucilage</span>.--The best
quality of mucilage in the market is made<br>
by dissolving clear glue in equal volumes of water and strong vinegar,<br>
and adding one-fourth of an equal volume of alcohol, and a small<br>
quantity of a solution of alum in water. Some of the cheaper<br>
preparations offered for sale are merely boiled starch or flour, mixed<br>
with nitric acid to prevent their gelatinizing.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acid-Proof Paste.</span>--A paste
formed by mixing powdered glass with a<br>
concentrated solution of silicate of soda makes an excellent acid-proof<br>
cement.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paste to Fasten Cloth to Wood.</span>--Take
a plump pound of wheat flour, one<br>
tablespoonful of powdered resin, one tablespoonful of finely powdered<br>
alum, and rub the mixture in a suitable vessel, with water, to a<br>
uniform, smooth paste; transfer this to a small kettle over a fire, and<br>
stir until the paste is perfectly homogeneous without lumps. As soon as<br>
the mass has become so stiff that the stirrer remains upright in it,<br>
transfer it to another vessel and cover it up so that no skin may form<br>
on its surface. This paste is applied in a very thin layer to the<br>
surface of the table; the cloth, or leather, is then laid and pressed<br>
upon it, and smoothed with a roller. The ends are cut off after drying.<br>
If leather is to be fastened on, this must first be moistened with<br>
water. The paste is then applied, and the leather rubbed smooth with a<br>
cloth.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Paste for Printing Office.-</span>-Take
two gallons of cold water and one quart<br>
wheat flour, rub out all the lumps, then add one-fourth pound of finely<br>
pulverized alum and boil the mixture for ten minutes, or until a thick<br>
consistency is reached. Now add one quart of hot water and, boil again,<br>
until the paste becomes a pale brown color, and thick. The paste should<br>
be well stirred during both processes of cooking. Paste thus made will<br>
keep sweet for two weeks and prove very adhesive.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Take Smoke Stains from Walls.</span>--An
easy and sure way to remove smoke<br>
stains from common plain ceilings is to mix wood ashes with the<br>
whitewash just before applying. A pint of ashes to a small pail of<br>
whitewash is sufficient, but a little more or less will do no harm.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Stains from Broadcloth.</span>--Take
an ounce of pipe clay, which has<br>
been ground fine, mix it with twelve drops of alcohol and the same<br>
quantity of spirits of turpentine. Whenever you wish to remove any<br>
stains from cloth, moisten a little of this mixture with alcohol and rub<br>
it on the spots. Let it remain till dry, then rub it off with a woolen<br>
cloth, and the spots will disappear.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Red Stains of Fruit from
Linen.</span>--Moisten the cloth and hold it<br>
over a piece of burning sulphur; then wash thoroughly, or else the spots<br>
may reappear.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Oil Stains.</span>--Take
three ounces of spirits of turpentine and<br>
one ounce of essence of lemon, mix well, and apply it as you would any<br>
other scouring drops. It will take out all the grease.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron Stains</span> may be removed by
the salt of lemons. Many stains may be<br>
removed by dipping the linen in some buttermilk, and then drying it in a<br>
hot sun; wash it in cold water; repeat this three or four times.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Oil Stains from Wood.</span>--Mix
together fuller's earth and soap<br>
lees, and rub it into the boards. Let it dry and then scour it off with<br>
some strong soft soap and sand, or use lees to scour it with. It should<br>
be put on hot, which may easily be done by heating the lees.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Tea Stains</span>.--Mix
thoroughly soft soap and salt--say a<br>
tablespoonful of salt to a teacupful of soap, rub on the spots, and<br>
spread the cloth on the grass where the sun will shine on it. Let it lie<br>
two or three days, then wash. If the spots are wet occasionally while<br>
lying on the grass, it will hasten the bleaching.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Stains from Muslin.</span>--If
you have stained your muslin or<br>
gingham dress, or similar articles, with berries, before wetting with<br>
anything else, pour boiling water through the stains and they will<br>
disappear. Before fruit juice dries it can often be removed by cold<br>
water, using a sponge and towel if necessary.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Acid Stains.</span>--Stains
caused by acids may be removed by tying<br>
some pearlash up in the stained part; scrape some soap in cold, soft<br>
water, and boil the linen until the stain is gone.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Disinfect Sinks and Drains.</span>--Copperas
dissolved in water, one-fourth<br>
of a pound to a gallon, and poured into a sink and water drain<br>
occasionally, will keep such places sweet and wholesome. A little<br>
chloride of lime, say half a pound to a gallon of water, will have the<br>
same effect, and either of these costs but a trifle.<br>
<br>
A preparation may be made at home which will answer about as well as the<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">chloride of lime</span>. Dissolve a
bushel of salt in a barrel of water, and<br>
with the salt water slake a barrel of lime, which should be made wet<br>
enough to form a thin paste or wash.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Disinfect a Cellar.</span>--A damp,
musty cellar may be sweetened by<br>
sprinkling upon the floor pulverized copperas, chloride of lime, or even<br>
common lime. The most effective means I have ever used to disinfect<br>
decaying vegetable matter is chloride of lime in solution. One pound may<br>
be dissolved in two gallons of water. Plaster of Paris has also been<br>
found an excellent absorbent of noxious odors. If used one part with<br>
three parts of charcoal, it will be found still better.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Thaw Out a Water Pipe.</span>--Water
pipes usually freeze up when<br>
exposed, for inside the walls, where they cannot be reached, they are or<br>
should be packed to prevent freezing. To thaw out a frozen pipe, bundle<br>
a newspaper into a torch, light it, and pass it along the pipe slowly.<br>
The ice will yield to this much quicker than to hot water or wrappings<br>
or hot cloths, as is the common practice.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Prevent Mold.</span>--A small
quantity of carbolic acid added to paste,<br>
mucilage and ink, will prevent mold. An ounce of the acid to a gallon of<br>
whitewash will keep cellars and dairies from the disagreeable odor which<br>
often taints milk and meat kept in such places.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thawing Frozen Gas Pipe.</span>--Mr.
F. H. Shelton says: "I took off from over<br>
the pipe, some four or five inches, just a crust of earth, and then put<br>
a couple of bushels of lime in the space, poured water over it, and<br>
slaked it, and then put canvas over that, and rocks on the canvas, so as<br>
to keep the wind from getting underneath. Next morning, on returning<br>
there, I found that the frost had been drawn out from the ground for<br>
nearly three feet. You can appreciate what an advantage that was, for<br>
picking through frozen ground, with the thermometer below zero, is no<br>
joke. Since then we have tried it several times. It is an excellent plan<br>
if you have time enough to let the time work. In the daytime you cannot<br>
afford to waste the time, but if you have a spare night in which to<br>
work, it is worth while to try it."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Test a Thermometer.</span>--The
common thermometer in a japanned iron<br>
case is usually inaccurate. To test the thermometer, bring water into<br>
the condition of active boiling, warm the thermometer gradually in the<br>
steam and then plunge it into the water. If it indicates a fixed<br>
temperature of two hundred and twelve degrees, the instrument is a good<br>
one.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Indelible Ink.</span>--An indelible
ink that cannot be erased, even with acids,<br>
can be obtained from the following recipe: To good gall ink add a strong<br>
solution of Prussian blue dissolved in distilled water. This will form a<br>
writing fluid which cannot be erased without destruction of the paper.<br>
The ink will write greenish blue, but afterward will turn black.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Get a Broken Cork Out of a Bottle.</span>--If,
in drawing a cork, it breaks,<br>
and the lower part falls down into the liquid, tie a long loop in a bit<br>
of twine, or small cord, and put it in, holding the bottle so as to<br>
bring the piece of cork near to the lower part of the neck. Catch it in<br>
the loop, so as to hold it stationary. You can then easily extract it<br>
with a corkscrew.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Wash for Cleaning Silver.</span>--Mix
together half an ounce of fine salt,<br>
half an ounce of powdered alum, and half an ounce of cream of tartar.<br>
Put them into a large white-ware pitcher, and pour on two ounces of<br>
water, and stir them frequently, till entirely dissolved. Then transfer<br>
the mixture to clean bottles and cork them closely. Before using it,<br>
shake the bottles well. Pour some of the liquid into a bowl, and wash<br>
the silver all over with it, using an old, soft, fine linen cloth. Let<br>
it stand about ten minutes, and then rub it dry with a buckskin. It will<br>
make the silver look like new.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove the Odor from a Vial.</span>--The
odor of its last contents may be<br>
removed from a vial by filling it with cold water, and letting it stand<br>
in any airy place uncorked for three days, changing the water every day.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Loosen a Glass Stopper</span>.--The
manner in which apothecaries loosen<br>
glass stoppers when there is difficulty in getting them out is to press<br>
the thumb of the right hand very hard against the lower part of the<br>
stopper, and then give the stopper a twist the other way, with the thumb<br>
and forefinger of the left hand, keeping the bottle stiff in a steady<br>
position.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Soften Boots and Shoes.</span>--Kerosene
will soften boots and shoes which<br>
have been hardened by water, and render them as pliable as new.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Stains, Spots, and Mildew
from Furniture.</span>--Take half a pint of<br>
ninety-eight per cent alcohol, a quarter of an ounce each of pulverized<br>
resin and gum shellac, add half a pint of linseed oil, shake well and<br>
apply with a brush or sponge. Sweet oil will remove finger marks from<br>
varnished furniture, and kerosene from oiled furniture.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Freshen Gilt Frames.</span>--Gilt
frames may be revived by carefully dusting<br>
them, and then washing with one ounce of soda beaten up with the whites<br>
of three eggs. Scraped patches should be touched up with gold paint.<br>
Castile soap and water, with proper care, may be used to clean oil<br>
paintings. Other methods should not be employed without some skill.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Fill Cracks in Plaster.</span>--Use
vinegar instead of water to mix your<br>
plaster of Paris. The resultant mass will be like putty, and will not<br>
"set" for twenty or thirty minutes, whereas if you use water the plaster<br>
will become hard almost immediately, before you have time to use it.<br>
Push it into the cracks and smooth it off nicely with a table knife.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Toughen Lamp Chimneys and Glassware.</span>--Immerse
the article in a pot<br>
filled with cold water, to which some common salt has been added. Boil<br>
the water well, then cool slowly. Glass treated in this way will resist<br>
any sudden change of temperature.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Remove Paint from Window-Glass.</span>--Rub
it well with hot, sharp vinegar.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Clean Stovepipe.</span>--A piece of
zinc put on the live coals in the stove<br>
will clean out the stovepipe.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Brighten Carpets.</span>--Carpets
after the dust has been beaten out may be<br>
brightened by scattering upon them cornmeal mixed with salt and then<br>
sweeping it off. Mix salt and meal in equal proportions. Carpets should<br>
be thoroughly beaten on the wrong side first and then on the right side,<br>
after which spots may be removed by the use of ox-gall or ammonia and<br>
water.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Keep Flowers Fresh</span> exclude
them from the air. To do this wet them<br>
thoroughly, put in a damp box, and cover with wet raw cotton or wet<br>
newspaper, then place in a cool spot. To preserve bouquets, put a little<br>
saltpetre in the water you use for your bouquets, and the flowers will<br>
live for a fortnight.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Preserve Brooms.</span>--Dip them
for a minute or two in a kettle of boiling<br>
suds once a week and they will last much longer, making them tough and<br>
pliable. A carpet wears much longer swept with a broom cared for in this<br>
manner.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Clean Brassware.</span>--Mix one
ounce of oxalic acid, six ounces of rotten<br>
stone, all in powder, one ounce of sweet oil, and sufficient water to<br>
make a paste. Apply a small proportion, and rub dry with a flannel or<br>
leather. The liquid dip most generally used consists of nitric and<br>
sulphuric acids, but this is more corrosive.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Keep Out Mosquitoes.</span>--If a
bottle of the oil of pennyroyal is left<br>
uncorked in a room at night, not a mosquito, nor any other blood-sucker,<br>
will be found there in the morning.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Kill Cockroaches.</span>--A
teacupful of well bruised plaster of Paris,<br>
mixed with double the quantity of oatmeal, to which a little sugar may<br>
be added, although this last named ingredient is not essential. Strew it<br>
on the floor, or into the chinks where they frequent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Destroy Ants.</span>--Drop some
quicklime on the mouth of their nest, and<br>
wash it with boiling water, or dissolve some camphor in spirits of wine,<br>
then mix with water, and pour into their haunts; or tobacco water, which<br>
has been found effectual. They are averse to strong scents. Camphor, or<br>
a sponge saturated with creosote, will prevent their infesting a<br>
cupboard. To prevent their climbing up trees, place a ring of tar about<br>
the trunk, or a circle of rag moistened occasionally with creosote.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Prevent Moths.</span>--In the month
of April or May, beat your fur garments<br>
well with a small cane or elastic stick, then wrap them up in linen,<br>
without pressing them too hard, and put betwixt the folds some camphor<br>
in small lumps; then put your furs in this state in boxes well closed.<br>
When the furs are wanted for use, beat them well as before, and expose<br>
them for twenty-four hours to the air, which will take away the smell of<br>
the camphor. If the fur has long hair, as bear or fox, add to the<br>
camphor an equal quantity of black pepper in powder.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Get Rid of Moths</span>--<br>
1. Procure shavings of cedar wood, and inclose in muslin bags, which can<br>
be distributed freely among the clothes.<br>
<br>
2. Procure shavings of camphor wood, and inclose in bags.<br>
<br>
3. Sprinkle pimento (allspice) berries among the clothes.<br>
<br>
4. Sprinkle the clothes with the seeds of the musk plant.<br>
<br>
5. To destroy the eggs, when deposited in woolen cloths, etc., use a<br>
solution of acetate of potash in spirits of rosemary, fifteen grains to<br>
the pint.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bed Bugs.</span>--Spirits of naphtha
rubbed with a small painter's brush into<br>
every part of the bedstead is a certain way of getting rid of bugs. The<br>
mattress and binding of the bed should be examined, and the same process<br>
attended to, as they generally harbor more in these parts than in the<br>
bedstead. Ten cents' worth of naphtha is sufficient for one bed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bug Poison.</span>--Proof spirit, one
pint; camphor, two ounces; oil of<br>
turpentine, four ounces; corrosive sublimate, one ounce. Mix. A<br>
correspondent says: "I have been for a long time troubled with bugs, and<br>
never could get rid of them by any clean and expeditious method, until a<br>
friend told me to suspend a small bag of camphor to the bed, just in the<br>
center, overhead. I did so, and the enemy was most effectually repulsed,<br>
and has not made his appearance since--not even for a reconnoissance!"<br>
This is a simple method of getting rid of these pests, and is worth a<br>
trial to see if it be effectual in other cases.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mixture for Destroying Flies</span>--Infusion
of quassia, one pint; brown<br>
sugar, four ounces; ground pepper, two ounces. To be well mixed<br>
together, and put in small, shallow dishes when required.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Destroy Flies</span> in a room,
take half a teaspoonful of black pepper in<br>
powder, one teaspoonful of brown sugar, and one tablespoonful of cream,<br>
mix them well together, and place them in the room on a plate, where the<br>
flies are troublesome, and they will soon disappear.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Drive Flies from the House.</span>--A
good way to rid the house of flies is<br>
to saturate small cloths with oil of sassafras and lay them in windows<br>
and doors. The flies will soon leave.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Aging Oak.</span>--Strong ammonia
fumes may be used for aging oak. Place the<br>
piece to be fumed, with an evaporating dish containing concentrated<br>
ammonia, in a box, and close it airtight. Leave for 12 hours and finish<br>
with a wax polish, applying first a thin coat of paraffine oil and then<br>
rubbing with a pomade of prepared wax made as follows: Two ounces each<br>
of yellow and white beeswax heated over a slow fire in a clean vessel<br>
(agate ware is good) until melted. Add 4 oz. turpentine and stir till<br>
entirely cool. Keep the turpentine away from the fire. This will give<br>
the oak a lustrous brown color, and nicking will not expose a different<br>
surface, as the ammonia fumes penetrate to a considerable depth.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">OPPORTUNITY.</span><br>
<br>
They do me wrong who say I come no more<br>
&nbsp; When once I've knocked and failed to find you in;<br>
For every day I stand outside your door,<br>
&nbsp; And bid you wake and ride, to fight and win.<br>
<br>
Wail not for precious chances passed away,<br>
&nbsp; Weep not for golden ages on the wane;<br>
Each night I burn the records of the day;<br>
&nbsp; At sunrise every soul is born again.<br>
<br>
Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped;<br>
&nbsp; To vanished hopes be blind and deaf and dumb;<br>
My judgments seal the dead past with its dead,<br>
&nbsp; But never bind a moment yet to come.<br>
<br>
Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep:<br>
&nbsp; I lend my arm to all who say. "I can."<br>
No shamefaced outcast ever sank so deep<br>
&nbsp; But yet might rise and be again a man!<br>
<br>
Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?<br>
&nbsp; Dost reel from righteous retribution's blow?<br>
Then turn from blotted archives of the past.<br>
&nbsp; And find the future's pages white as snow.<br>
<br>
Art thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell!<br>
&nbsp; Art thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven;<br>
Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell.<br>
&nbsp; Each night a star to guide to Heaven!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DR. SPURZHEIM'S PHRENOLOGY.</span><br>
<br>
The first claim put forth by the teachers and professional demonstrators<br>
of phrenology makes it a system of mental philosophy, besides at the<br>
same time presenting a much more popular aspect as a method whereby the<br>
disposition, character and natural aptitude of the individual may be<br>
ascertained.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 685px; height: 416px;" alt="" src="images/251Pic.jpg"><br>
<br>
These two features of the subject are quite distinct from each other,<br>
for, while it can serve as a reliable guide for reading character only<br>
on the assumption of its truth as a philosophic system, yet the<br>
possibility of its practical application does not necessarily follow<br>
from the establishment of the truth of its theoretical side.<br>
<br>
Two of the earliest founders of the science of anatomy, Erasistratus and<br>
Herophilus, who lived in the age of Ptolemy Soter, taught that the brain<br>
was the seat of sensation and intellect, and that there was therein a<br>
certain degree of localization of function. Galen later taught that the<br>
brain is the seat of the soul and intellect. From these facts of history<br>
the system of phrenology, though formulated by Dr. Gall, Dr. Spurzheim,<br>
the Fowler Brothers and others, rests upon deductions derived from the<br>
teachings of the demonstrators of anatomy and students of philosophy.<br>
<br>
The formulated system of phrenology is very generally believed to be a<br>
modern expansion of an old empirical philosophy, but, according to Dr.<br>
Gall's account, it arose with him as the result of independent<br>
observations. The popularity of phrenology has waned in the public mind,<br>
and cultivation of the system is confined to a few enthusiasts, such as<br>
pose as teachers of it as a vocation. These claim that phrenology is a<br>
practical and important science and that it rests upon the following<br>
principles:<br>
<br>
First--That the human brain is the organ of the mind.<br>
<br>
Second--That the mental powers of man can be analyzed into a definite<br>
number of measurably independent faculties.<br>
<br>
Third--That these faculties are innate, and each has its seat in a<br>
definite region of the brain.<br>
<br>
Fourth--That the size of each of these regions is the measure of the<br>
power of manifesting the faculty associated with it.<br>
<br>
The faculties and their localities, as originally constructed by Dr.<br>
Gall, were for the most part identified on slender grounds. His<br>
procedure was as follows: Having selected the place of a faculty, he<br>
examined the heads of his friends and casts of persons with that<br>
peculiarity in common, and in them sought for the distinctive feature of<br>
their characteristic trait. Some of his earlier studies were among low<br>
associates in jails and lunatic asylums, and some of the qualities<br>
located by him were such as tend to perversion to crime. These he named<br>
after their excessive manifestations, and thus mapped out organs of<br>
theft, murder, etc. This, however, caused the system to be discredited.<br>
Later his pupil, Dr. Spurzheim, claimed that the moral and religious<br>
features belonging to it greatly modified these characteristics of Dr.<br>
Gall's work. The chart of the human head as invented by Dr. Gall<br>
represented 26 organs; the chart as improved by Dr. Spurzheim makes out<br>
35 organs. This is the chart now generally used and which is shown on a<br>
preceding page. The number specifies the location of each organ, which<br>
is followed by its phrenological name, and classified as follows:<br>
<br>
Propensities. (1) Amativeness. (2) Philoprogenitiveness. (3)<br>
Concentrativeness. (4) Adhesiveness. (5) Combativeness. (6)<br>
Destructiveness. (6a) Alimentiveness. (7) Secretiveness. (8)<br>
Acquisitiveness. (9) Constructiveness.<br>
<br>
Lower Sentiments. (10) Self-esteem. (11) Love of Approbation. (12)<br>
Cautiousness.<br>
<br>
Superior Sentiments. (13) Benevolence. (14) Veneration. (15)<br>
Conscientiousness. (16) Firmness. (17) Hope. (18) Wonder. (19) Ideality.<br>
(20) Wit. (21) Imitation.<br>
<br>
Perceptive Faculties. (22) Individuality. (23) Form. (24) Size. (25)<br>
Weight. (26) Color. (27) Locality. (28) Number. (29) Order. (30)<br>
Eventuality. (31) Time. (32) Tune. (33) Language.<br>
<br>
Reflective Faculties. (34) Comparison. (35) Causality. The judgment of<br>
the phrenologist is determined by the size of the brain in general, and<br>
by the size of the organs that have been formulated, and these are<br>
estimated by certain arbitrary rules that render the boundaries of the<br>
regions indefinite.<br>
<br>
The controversy over phrenology has served undoubtedly the very useful<br>
purpose of stimulating research into the anatomy of the brain.<br>
<br>
It is generally conceded that any psychological theory which correlates<br>
brain-action and mental phenomena requires a correspondence between the<br>
size of the brain and mental power, and generally observation shows that<br>
the brains of those whose capacities are above the average are larger<br>
than those of the general run of their fellow men.<br>
<br>
A study of the cuts and comparison of the sizes of different heads and<br>
their shape will prove very entertaining with most any group of persons<br>
intellectually inclined, and it will be found that persons who are<br>
naturally good readers by instinct of human nature can, with its help,<br>
make remarkable readings in the delineation of character.<br>

pending.<br>
<br>
Rule A--Undebatable, but remarks may be tacitly allowed.<br>
<br>
Rule B--Undebatable if another question is before the assembly.<br>
<br>

stated by the chair except by general consent.<br>
<br>
Only one reconsideration of a question is permitted.<br>
<br>
A motion to adjourn, to lay on the table, or to take from the table,<br>
cannot be renewed unless some other motion has been made in the<br>
interval.<br>
<br>
On motion to strike out the words, "Shall the words stand part of the<br>
motion?" unless a majority sustains the words, they are struck out.<br>
<br>
On motion for previous question, the form to be observed is, "Shall the<br>
main question be now put?" This, if carried, ends debate.<br>
<br>
On an appeal from the chair's decision, "Shall the decision be sustained<br>
as the ruling of the house?" The chair is generally sustained.<br>
<br>
On motion for orders of the day, "Will the house now proceed to the<br>
orders of the day?" This, if carried, supersedes intervening motions.<br>
<br>
When an objection is raised to considering questions, "Shall the<br>
question be considered?" Objections may be made by any member before<br>
debate has commenced, but not subsequently.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">LETTER COMBINATIONS.</span><br>
<br>
When King Stanislaus of Poland, then a young man, came back from a<br>
journey, the whole Lescinskian House gathered together at Lissa to<br>
receive him. The schoolmaster, Jablowsky, prepared a festival in<br>
commemoration of the event, and had it end with a ballet performed by<br>
thirteen students, dressed as cavaliers. Each had a shield, upon which<br>
one of the letters of the words "Domus Lescinia" (The Lescinskian House)<br>
was written in gold. After the first dance, they stood in such a manner<br>
that their shields read "Domus Lescinia"; after the second dance, they<br>
changed order, making it read, "Ades incolumnis" (Unharmed art thou<br>
here); after the third. "Mane sidus loci" (Continue the star of this<br>
place); after the fourth, "Sis coumna Dei" (Be a pillar of God); and<br>
finally, "I! scade solium!" (Go! ascend the throne). Indeed, these two<br>
words allow of 1,556,755,200 transpositions; yet that five of them<br>
convey independent and appropriate meanings is certainly very curious.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS OF CRIMINAL LAW.</span><br>
<br>
You cannot lawfully condone an offence by receiving back stolen<br>
property,<br>
<br>
The exemption of females from arrest applies only in civil, not in<br>
criminal matters.<br>
<br>
Every man is bound to obey the call of a sheriff for assistance in<br>
making an arrest.<br>
<br>
The rule "Every man's house is his castle" does not hold good when a man<br>
is accused of crime.<br>
<br>
Embezzlement can be charged only against a clerk or servant, or the<br>
officer or agent of a corporation.<br>
<br>
Bigamy cannot be proven in law if one party to a marriage has been<br>
absent and not heard from for five years.<br>
<br>
Grand larceny is when the value of property stolen exceeds $25.00--When<br>
less than that, the offence is petit larceny.<br>
<br>
Arson to be in the first degree must have been committed at night and<br>
the buildings fired must have been inhabited.<br>
<br>
Drunkenness is not a legal excuse for crime, but delirium tremens is<br>
considered by the law as a species of insanity.<br>
<br>
In a case of assault it is only necessary to prove an "offer or attempt<br>
at assault."<br>
<br>
Battery presumes physical violence.<br>
<br>
Mayhem, although popularly supposed to refer to injury to the face, lip,<br>
tongue, eye, or ear, applies to any injury done a limb.<br>
<br>
A felony is a crime punishable by imprisonment in a State prison; an<br>
"infamous" crime is one punishable with death or State prison.<br>
<br>
A police officer is not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant<br>
unless he has personal knowledge of the offense for which the arrest is<br>
made.<br>
<br>
An accident is not a crime, unless criminal carelessness can be proven.<br>
A man shooting at a burglar and killing a member of his family is not a<br>
murderer.<br>
<br>
Burglary in the first degree can be committed only in the night time.<br>
Twilight, if dark enough to prevent distinguishing a man's face, is the<br>
same as "night" in law.<br>
<br>
Murder to be in the first degree must be willful, premeditated and<br>
malicious, or committed while the murderer is engaged in a felonious<br>
act. The killing of a man in a duel is murder, and it is a misdemeanor<br>
to accept or give a challenge.<br>
<br>
False swearing is perjury in law only when willfully done, and when the<br>
oath has been legally administered. Such qualifying expressions as "to<br>
the best of my belief," "as I am informed," may save an averment from<br>
being perjured. The law is that the false statement sworn to must be<br>
absolute. Subornation of perjury is a felony.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TO TELL PURE WATER.</span><br>
<br>
The color, odor, taste and purity of water can be ascertained as<br>
follows: Fill a large bottle made of colorless glass with water; look<br>
through the water at some black object. Pour out some of the water and<br>
leave the bottle half full; cork the bottle and place it for a few hours<br>
in a warm place; shake up the water, remove the cork, and critically<br>
smell the air contained in the bottle. If it has any smell, particularly<br>
if the odor is repulsive, the water should not be used for domestic<br>
purposes. By heating the water an odor is evolved that would not<br>
otherwise appear. Water fresh from the well is usually tasteless, even<br>
if it contains a large amount of putrescible organic matter. All water<br>
for domestic purposes should be perfectly tasteless, and remain so even<br>
after it has been warmed, since warming often develops a taste in water<br>
which is tasteless when cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HAND GRENADES.</span><br>
<br>
Take chloride of calcium, crude, 20 parts; common salt, 5 parts; and<br>
water, 75 parts. Mix and put in thin bottles. In case of fire, a bottle<br>
so thrown that it will break in or very near the fire will put it out.<br>
This mixture is better and cheaper than many of the high-priced<br>
grenades sold for the purpose of fire protection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO GET RID OF RATS.</span><br>
<br>
Get a piece of lead pipe and use it as a funnel to introduce about 1-1/2<br>
ounces of sulphite of potassium into any outside holes tenanted by rats.<br>
Not to be used in dwellings. To get rid of mice use tartar emetic<br>
mingled with any favorite food; they will eat, sicken and take their<br>
leave.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">FRIENDLY ADVICE ON MANY SUBJECTS.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tomato in Bright's Disease.</span><br>
<br>
When Thomas Jefferson brought the tomato from France to America,<br>
thinking that if it could be induced to grow bountifully it might make<br>
good feed for hogs, he little dreamed of the benefit he was conferring<br>
upon posterity. A constant diet of raw tomatoes and skim-milk is said to<br>
be a certain cure for Bright's disease. Gen. Schenck, who, when Minister<br>
to England, became a victim to that complaint, was restored to health by<br>
two years of this regimen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relief for Asthma.</span><br>
<br>
An old friend of the editor of this book writes: "I have been a sufferer<br>
from asthma for twenty-five years, and for more than a dozen years have<br>
used the following recipe with great benefit. It is not a cure, but in<br>
my case gives almost instant relief. Take equal parts of powdered<br>
stramonium leaves and powdered belladonna leaves and mix thoroughly; to<br>
each ten ounces of the mixture add one ounce of powdered saltpeter<br>
(nitrate of potash); mix all thoroughly. I always keep some of this in a<br>
small tin box. When I wish to use it I pour a little of the powder into<br>
the cover of the box, light it with a match, cover the whole with a<br>
little paper cone with the point cut off. I place the point of the cone<br>
in my mouth, and breathe the smoke into my lungs with the air. The first<br>
trial is very hard; it almost strangles, but if persevered in will give<br>
great relief. This is much better than stramonium alone. The saltpeter<br>
makes it burn freely, and also helps to give relief. When my home was in<br>
Northern Indiana, I used to buy the leaves in Chicago already powdered.<br>
Now I send to New York. I find it cheaper to do this than to gather and<br>
dry the leaves. It is also almost impossible to dry and pulverize the<br>
leaves at home. By using a paper cone and breathing through it, little<br>
or no smoke is wasted, and the box and paper can be carried in the<br>
pocket and used as occasion requires."<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Swollen Feet.</span><br>
<br>
Policemen, mail carriers, and others whose occupation keeps them on<br>
their feet a great deal, often are troubled with chafed, sore and<br>
blistered feet, especially in extremely hot weather, no matter how<br>
comfortably their shoes may lit. A powder is used in the German army for<br>
sifting into the shoes and stockings of the foot soldiers, called<br>
"Fusstreupulver," and consists of 3 parts salicylic acid, 10 parts<br>
starch and 87 parts pulverized soapstone.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules for Fat People and for Lean.</span><br>
<br>
To increase the weight: Eat to the extent of satisfying; a natural<br>
appetite, of fat meats, butter, cream, milk, cocoa, chocolate, bread,<br>
potatoes, peas, parsnips, carrots, beets, farinaceous foods, as Indian<br>
corn, rice, tapioca, sago, corn starch, pastry, custards, oatmeal,<br>
sugar, sweet wines, and ale. Avoid acids. Exercise as little as<br>
possible, and sleep all you can.<br>
<br>
To reduce the weight: Eat to the extent of satisfying a natural<br>
appetite, of lean meat, poultry, game, eggs, milk moderately, green<br>
vegetables, turnips, succulent fruits, tea or coffee. Drink lime juice,<br>
lemonade, and acid drinks. Avoid fat, butter, cream, sugar, pastry,<br>
rice, sago, tapioca, corn starch, potatoes, carrots, beets, parsnips,<br>
and sweet wines.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When Quinine Will Break Up a Cold.</span><br>
<br>
It is surprising, says a family physician, how certainly a cold may be<br>
broken up by a timely dose of quinine. When first symptoms make their<br>
appearance, when a little languor, slight hoarseness and ominous<br>
tightening of the nasal membranes follow exposure to draughts or sudden<br>
chill by wet, five grains of this useful alkaloid are sufficient in many<br>
cases to end the trouble. But it must be done promptly. If the golden<br>
moment passes, nothing suffices to stop the weary sneezing,<br>
handkerchief-using, red-nose and woe begone looking periods that<br>
certainly follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Mistaken Idea.</span><br>
<br>
The old adage. "Feed a cold and starve a fever." is characterized by the<br>
Journal of Health as very silly advice. If anything, the reverse would<br>
be nearer right. When a person has a severe cold it is best for him to<br>
eat very lightly, especially during the first few days of the attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hints on Bathing.</span><br>
<br>
There has been a great deal written about bathing. The surface of the<br>
skin is punctured with millions of little holes called pores. The duty<br>
of these pores is to carry the waste matter off. For instance,<br>
perspiration. Now, if these pores are stopped up they are of no use, and<br>
the body has to find some other way to get rid of its impurities. Then<br>
the liver has more than it can do. Then we take a liver pill when we<br>
ought to clean out the pores instead. The housewife is very particular<br>
to keep her sieves in good order; after she has strained a substance<br>
through them they are washed out carefully with water, because water is<br>
the best thing known. That is the reason water is used to bathe in. But<br>
the skin is a little different from a sieve, because it is willing to<br>
help along the process itself. All it needs is a little encouragement<br>
and it will accomplish wonders. What the skin wants is rubbing. If you<br>
should quietly sit down in a tub of water and as quietly get up and dry<br>
off without rubbing, your skin wouldn't be much benefited. The water<br>
would make it a little soft, especially if it was warm. But rubbing is<br>
the great thing. Stand where the sunlight strikes a part of your body,<br>
then take a dry brush and rub it, and you will notice that countless<br>
little flakes of cuticle fly off. Every time one of these flakes is<br>
removed from the skin your body breathes a sigh of relief. An eminent<br>
German authority contends that too much bathing is a bad thing. There is<br>
much truth in this. Soap and water are good things to soften up the<br>
skin, but rubbing is what the skin wants. Every morning or every<br>
evening, or when it is most convenient, wash the body all over with<br>
water and a little ammonia, or anything which tends to make the water<br>
soft; then rub dry with a towel, and after that go over the body from<br>
top to toe with a dry brush. Try this for two or three weeks, and your<br>
skin will be like velvet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tea and Coffee.</span><br>
<br>
Tea is a nerve stimulant, pure and simple, acting like alcohol in this<br>
respect, without any value that the latter may possess as a retarder of<br>
waste. It has a special influence upon those nerve centers that supply<br>
will power, exalting their sensibility beyond normal activity, and may<br>
even produce hysterical symptoms, if carried far enough. Its active<br>
principle, theine, is an exceedingly powerful drug, chiefly employed by<br>
nerve specialists as a pain destroyer, possessing the singular quality<br>
of working toward the surface. That is to say, when a dose is<br>
administered hypodermically for sciatica, for example, the narcotic<br>
influence proceeds outward from the point of injection, instead of<br>
inward toward the centers, as does that of morphia, atropia, etc. Tea is<br>
totally devoid of nutritive value, and the habit of drinking it to<br>
excess, which so many American women indulge in, particularly in the<br>
country, is to be deplored as a cause of our American nervousness.<br>
Coffee, on the contrary, is a nerve food. Like other concentrated foods<br>
of its class, it operates as a stimulant also, but upon a different set<br>
of nerves from tea. Taken strong in the morning, it often produces<br>
dizziness and that peculiar visual symptom of overstimulus which is<br>
called muscae volilantes--dancing flies. But this is an improper way to<br>
take it, and rightly used it is perhaps the most valuable liquid<br>
addition to the morning meal. Its active principle, caffeine, differs in<br>
all physiological respects from theine, while it is chemically very<br>
closely allied, and its limited consumption makes it impotent for harm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To Straighten Round Shoulders.</span><br>
<br>
A stooping figure and a halting gait, accompanied by the unavoidable<br>
weakness of lungs incidental to a narrow chest, may be entirely cured by<br>
the very simple and easily-performed exercise of raising one's self<br>
upon the toes leisurely in a perpendicular position several times daily.<br>
To take this exercise properly one must take a perfectly upright<br>
position. With the heels together and the toes at an angle of forty-five<br>
degrees. Then drop the arms lifelessly by the sides, animating and<br>
raising the chest to its full capacity and muscularity, the chin well<br>
drawn in, and the crown of the head feeling as if attached to a string<br>
suspended from the ceiling above. Slowly rise upon the balls of both<br>
feet to the greatest possible height, thereby exercising all the muscles<br>
of the legs and body; come again into standing position without swaying<br>
the body backward out of the perfect line. Repeat this same exercise,<br>
first on one foot, then on the other. It is wonderful what a<br>
straightening-out power this exercise has upon round shoulders and<br>
crooked backs, and one will be surprised to note how soon the lungs<br>
begin to show the effect of such expansive development.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Care of the Eyes.</span><br>
<br>
In consequence of the increase of affections of the eye, a specialist<br>
has recently formulated the following rules to be observed in the care<br>
of the eyes for school work: A comfortable temperature, dry and warm<br>
feet, good ventilation; clothing at the neck and on other parts of the<br>
body loose; posture erect, and never read lying down or stooping. Little<br>
study before breakfast or directly after a heavy meal; none at all at<br>
twilight or late at night; use great caution about studying after<br>
recovery from fevers; have light abundant, but not dazzling, not<br>
allowing the sun to shine on desks or on objects in front of the<br>
scholars, and letting the light come from the left hand or left and<br>
rear; hold book at right angles to the line of sight or nearly so; give<br>
eyes frequent rest by looking up. The distance of the book from the eye<br>
should be about fifteen inches. The usual indication of strain is<br>
redness of the rim of the eyelid, betokening a congested state of the<br>
inner surface, which may be accompanied with some pain. When the eye<br>
tires easily rest is not the proper remedy, but the use of glasses of<br>
sufficient power to aid in accommodating the eye to vision.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How and When to Drink Water.</span><br>
<br>
According to Doctor Leuf, when water is taken into the full or partly<br>
full stomach, it does not mingle with the food, as we are taught, but<br>
passes along quickly between the food and lesser curvature toward the<br>
pylorus, through which it passes into the intestines. The secretion of<br>
mucus by the lining membrane is constant, and during the night a<br>
considerable amount accumulates in the stomach; some of its liquid<br>
portion is absorbed, and that which remains is thick and tenacious. If<br>
food is taken into the stomach when in this condition, it becomes coated<br>
with this mucus, and the secretion of the gastric juice and its action<br>
are delayed. These facts show the value of a goblet of water before<br>
breakfast. This washes out the tenacious mucus, and stimulates the<br>
gastric glands to secretion. In old and feeble persons water should not<br>
be taken cold, but it may be with great advantage taken warm or hot.<br>
This removal of the accumulated mucus from the stomach is probably one<br>
of the reasons why taking soup at the beginning of a meal has been found<br>
so beneficial.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What Causes Coughs.</span><br>
<br>
Cold and coughs are prevalent throughout the country, but throat<br>
affections are by far more common among business men. Every unfortunate<br>
one mutters something about the abominable weather and curses the<br>
piercing wind. Much of the trouble, however, is caused by overheated<br>
rooms, and a little more attention to proper ventilation would remove<br>
the cause of suffering. Doctor J. Ewing Mears, who was thus afflicted,<br>
said to an inquirer: "The huskiness and loss of power of articulation so<br>
common among us are largely due to the use of steam for heating. The<br>
steam cannot be properly regulated, and the temperature becomes too<br>
high. A person living in this atmosphere has all the cells of the lungs<br>
open, and when he passes into the open air he is unduly exposed. The<br>
affliction is quite common among the men who occupy offices in the new<br>
buildings which are fitted up with all modern improvements. The<br>
substitution of electric light for gas has wrought a change to which<br>
people have not yet adapted themselves. The heat arising from a number<br>
of gas jets will quickly raise the temperature of a room, and<br>
unconsciously people rely upon that means of heating to some extent.<br>
Very little warmth, however, is produced by the electric light, and when<br>
a man reads by an incandescent light he at times finds himself becoming<br>
chilly, and wonders why it is. Too hot during the day and too cold at<br>
night are conditions which should be avoided."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PHYSICAL EXERCISE.</span><br>
<br>
The principal methods of developing the physique now prescribed by<br>
trainers are exercise with dumbbells, the bar bell and the chest weight.<br>
The rings and horizontal and parallel bars are also used, but not nearly<br>
to the extent that they formerly were. The movement has been all in the<br>
direction of the simplification of apparatus; in fact, one well-known<br>
teacher of the Boston Gymnasium when asked his opinion said: "Four bare<br>
walls and a floor, with a well-posted instructor, is all that is really<br>
required for a gymnasium."<br>
<br>
Probably the most important as well as the simplest appliance for<br>
gymnasium work is the wooden dumbbell, which has displaced the ponderous<br>
iron bell of former days. Its weight is from three-quarters of a pound<br>
to a pound and a half, and with one in each hand a variety of motions<br>
can be gone through, which are of immense benefit in building up or<br>
toning down every muscle and all vital parts of the body.<br>
<br>
The first object of an instructor in taking a beginner in hand is to<br>
increase the circulation. This is done by exercising the extremities,<br>
the first movement being one of the hands, after which come the wrists,<br>
then the arms, and next the head and feet. As the circulation is<br>
increased the necessity for a larger supply of oxygen, technically<br>
called "oxygen-hunger," is created, which is only satisfied by breathing<br>
exercises, which develop the lungs. After the circulation is in a<br>
satisfactory condition, the dumbbell instructor turns his attention to<br>
exercising the great muscles of the body, beginning with those of the<br>
back, strengthening which holds the body erect, thus increasing the<br>
chest capacity, invigorating the digestive organs, and, in fact, all the<br>
vital functions. By the use of very light weights an equal and<br>
symmetrical development of all parts of the body is obtained, and then<br>
there are no sudden demands on the heart and lungs.<br>
<br>
After the dumbbell comes exercise with the round, or bar bell. This is<br>
like the dumbbell, with the exception that the bar connecting the balls<br>
is four or five feet, instead of a few inches in length. Bar bells weigh<br>
from one to two pounds each and are found most useful in building up the<br>
respiratory and digestive systems, their especial province being the<br>
strengthening of the erector muscles and increasing the flexibility of<br>
the chest.<br>
<br>
Of all fixed apparatus in use the pulley weight stands easily first in<br>
importance. These weights are available for a greater variety of objects<br>
than any other gymnastic appliance, and can be used either for general<br>
exercise or for strengthening such muscles as most require it. With them<br>
a greater localization is possible than with the dumbbell, and for this<br>
reason they are recommended as a kind of supplement to the latter. As<br>
chest developers and correctors of round shoulders they are most<br>
effective. As the name implies, they are simply weights attached to<br>
ropes, which pass over pulleys, and are provided with handles. The<br>
common pulley is placed at about the height of the shoulder of an<br>
average man, but recently those which can be adjusted to any desired<br>
height have been very generally introduced.<br>
<br>
When more special localization is desired than can be obtained by means<br>
of the ordinary apparatus, what is known as the double-action chest<br>
weight is used. This differs from the ordinary kind in being provided<br>
with several pulleys, so that the strain may come at different angles.<br>
Double-action weights may be divided into three classes--high, low, and<br>
side pulleys--each with its particular use.<br>
<br>
The highest of all, known as the giant pulleys, are made especially for<br>
developing the muscles of the back and chest, and by stretching or<br>
elongating movements to increase the interior capacity of the chest. If<br>
the front of the chest is full and the back or side chest deficient, the<br>
pupil is set to work on the giant pulley. To build up the side-walls he<br>
stands with the back to the pulley-box and the left heel resting against<br>
it; the handle is grasped in the right hand if the right side of the<br>
chest is lacking in development, and then drawn straight down by the<br>
side; a step forward with the right foot, as long as possible, is taken,<br>
the line brought as far to the front and near the floor as can be done,<br>
and then the arm, held stiff, allowed to be drawn solely up by the<br>
weight. To exercise the left side the same process is gone through with,<br>
the handle grasped in the left hand. Another kind of giant pulley is<br>
that which allows the operator to stand directly under it, and is used<br>
for increasing the lateral diameter of the chest. The handles are drawn<br>
straight down by the sides, the arms are then spread and drawn back by<br>
the weights. Generally speaking, high pulleys are most used for<br>
correcting high, round shoulders; low pulleys for low, round shoulders;<br>
side pulleys for individual high or low shoulders, and giant pulleys for<br>
the development of the walls of the chest and to correct spinal<br>
curvature.<br>
<br>
The traveling rings, a line of iron rings, covered with rubber and<br>
attached to long ropes fastened to the ceiling some ten feet apart, are<br>
also valuable in developing the muscles of the back, arms and sides. The<br>
first ring is grasped in one hand and a spring taken from an elevated<br>
platform. The momentum carries the gymnast to the next ring, which is<br>
seized with the free hand, and so the entire length of the line is<br>
traversed. The parallel bars, low and high, the flying rings, the<br>
horizontal bar and the trapeze all have their uses, but of late years<br>
they have been relegated to a position of distinct inferiority to that<br>
now occupied by the dumbbells and pulley weights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES.</span><br>
<br>
What To Do<br>
<br>
If an artery is cut, red blood spurts. Compress it above the wound. If a<br>
vein is cut, dark blood flows. Compress it below and above.<br>
<br>
If choked, go upon all fours and cough.<br>
<br>
For slight burns, dip the part in cold water; if the skin is destroyed,<br>
cover with varnish or linseed oil.<br>
<br>
For apoplexy, raise the head and body; for fainting, lay the person<br>
flat.<br>
<br>
Send for a physician when a serious accident of any kind occurs, but<br>
treat as directed until he arrives.<br>
<br>
Scalds and Burns--The following facts cannot be too firmly impressed on<br>
the mind of the reader, that in either of these accidents the first,<br>
best, and often the only remedies required, are sheets of wadding, fine<br>
wool, or carded cotton, and, in the default of these, violet powder,<br>
flour, magnesia, or chalk. The object for which these several articles<br>
are employed is the same in each instance; namely, to exclude the air<br>
from the injured part; for if the air can be effectually shut out from<br>
the raw surface, and care is taken not to expose the tender part till<br>
the new cuticle is formed, the cure may be safely left to nature. The<br>
moment a person is called to a case of scald or burn, he should cover<br>
the part with a sheet, or a portion of a sheet, of wadding, taking care<br>
not to break any blister that may have formed, or stay to remove any<br>
burnt clothes that may adhere to the surface, but as quickly as possible<br>
envelop every part of the injury from all access of the air, laying one<br>
or two more pieces of wadding on the first, so as effectually to guard<br>
the burn or scald from the irritation of the atmosphere; and if the<br>
article used is wool or cotton, the same precaution, of adding more<br>
material where the surface is thinly covered, must be adopted; a light<br>
bandage finally securing all in their places. Any of the popular<br>
remedies recommended below may be employed when neither wool, cotton,<br>
nor wadding are to be procured, it being always remembered that that<br>
article which will best exclude the air from a burn or scald is the<br>
best, quickest, and least painful mode of treatment. And in this respect<br>
nothing has surpassed cotton loose or attached to paper as in wadding.<br>
<br>
If the Skin is Much Injured in burns, spread some linen pretty thickly<br>
with chalk ointment, and lay over the part, and give the patient some<br>
brandy and water if much exhausted; then send for a medical man. If not<br>
much injured, and very painful, use the same ointment, or apply carded<br>
cotton dipped in lime water and linseed oil. If you please, you may lay<br>
cloths dipped in ether over the parts, or cold lotions. Treat scalds in<br>
same manner, or cover with scraped raw potato; but the chalk ointment is<br>
the best. In the absence of all these, cover the injured part with<br>
treacle, and dust over it plenty of flour.<br>
<br>
BODY IN FLAMES--Lay the person down on the floor of the room, and throw<br>
the table cloth, rug, or other large cloth over him, and roll him on the<br>
floor.<br>
<br>
DIRT IN THE EYE--Place your forefinger upon the cheek-bone, having the<br>
patient before you; then slightly bend the finger, this will draw down<br>
the lower lid of the eye, and you will probably be able to remove the<br>
dirt; but if this will not enable you to get at it, repeat this<br>
operation while you have a knitting-needle or bodkin placed over the<br>
eyelid; this will turn it inside out, and enable you to remove the sand,<br>
or eyelash, etc., with the corner of a fine silk handkerchief. As soon<br>
as the substance is removed, bathe the eye with cold water, and exclude<br>
the light for a day. If the inflammation is severe, let the patient use<br>
a refrigerant lotion.<br>
<br>
LIME IN THE EVE--Syringe it well with warm vinegar and water in the<br>
proportion of one ounce of vinegar to eight ounces of water; exclude<br>
light.<br>
<br>
IRON OR STEEL SPICULAE IN THE EYE--These occur while turning iron or<br>
steel in a lathe, and are best remedied by doubling back the upper or<br>
lower eyelid according to the situation of the substance, and with the<br>
flat edge of a silver probe, taking up the metallic particle, using a<br>
lotion made by dissolving six grains of sugar of lead and the same of<br>
white vitriol, in six ounces of water, and bathing the eye three times a<br>
day till the inflammation subsides. Another plan is--Drop a solution of<br>
sulphate of copper (from one to three grains of salt to one ounce of<br>
water) into the eye, or keep the eye open in a wineglassful of the<br>
solution. Bathe with cold lotion, and exclude light to keep down<br>
inflammation.<br>
<br>
DISLOCATED THUMB--This is frequently produced by a fall. Make a clove<br>
hitch, by passing two loops of cord over the thumb, placing a piece of<br>
rag under the cord to prevent it cutting the thumb; then pull in the<br>
same line as the thumb. Afterwards apply a cold lotion.<br>
<br>
CUTS AND WOUNDS--Clean cut wounds whether deep or superficial, and<br>
likely to heal by the first intention, should always be washed or<br>
cleaned, and at once evenly and smoothly closed by bringing both edges<br>
close together and securing them in that position by adhesive plaster.<br>
Cut thin strips of sticking plaster, and bring the parts together; or,<br>
if large and deep, cut two broad pieces, so as to look like the teeth of<br>
a comb, and place one on each side of the wound, which must be cleaned<br>
previously. These pieces must be arranged so that they shall interlace<br>
one another; then, by laying hold of the pieces on the right side with<br>
one hand, and those on the other side with the other hand and pulling<br>
them from one another, the edges of the wounds are brought together<br>
without any difficulty.<br>
<br>
Ordinary Cuts are dressed by thin strips, applied by pressing down the<br>
plaster on one side of the wound, and keeping it there, and pulling in<br>
the opposite direction; then suddenly depressing the hand when the edges<br>
of the wound are brought together.<br>
<br>
CONTUSIONS are best healed by laying a piece of folded lint, well wetted<br>
with extract of lead or boracic acid, on the part, and, if there is much<br>
pain, placing a hot bran poultice over the dressing, repeating both if<br>
necessary every, two hours. When the injuries are very severe lay a<br>
cloth over the part, and suspend a basin over it filled with cold<br>
lotion. Put a piece of cotton into the basin, so that it shall allow the<br>
lotion to drop on the cloth, and thus keep it always wet.<br>
<br>
HEMORRHAGE, when caused by an artery being divided or torn, may be known<br>
by the blood issuing out of the wound in leaps or jerks, and being of a<br>
bright scarlet color. If a vein is injured, the blood is darker and<br>
flows continuously. To arrest the latter apply pressure by means of a<br>
compress and bandage. To arrest arterial bleeding, get a piece of wood<br>
(part of a broom handle will do), and tie a piece of tape to one end of<br>
it. Then tie a piece of tape loosely over the arm, and pass the other<br>
end of the wood under it; twist the stick around and around until the<br>
tape compresses the arm sufficiently to arrest the bleeding, and then<br>
confine the other end by tying the string around the arm. A compress<br>
made by enfolding a penny piece in several folds of lint or linen<br>
should, however, be first placed under the tape and over the artery, If<br>
the bleeding is very obstinate, and it occurs in the arm, place a cork<br>
underneath the string, on the inside of the fleshy part, where the<br>
artery may be felt beating by any one; if in the leg, place a cork in<br>
the direction of a line drawn from the inner part of the knee toward the<br>
outer part of the groin. It is an excellent thing to accustom yourself<br>
to find out the position of these arteries, or, indeed, any that are<br>
superficial, and to explain to every person in your house where they<br>
are, and how to stop bleeding. If a stick cannot be got, take a<br>
handkerchief, make a cord bandage of it, and tie a knot in the middle;<br>
the knot acts as a compress, and should be placed over the artery, while<br>
the two ends are c around the thumb. Observe always to place<br>
the ligature between the wound and the heart. Putting your finger into a<br>
bleeding wound, and making pressure until a surgeon arrives, will<br>
generally stop violent bleeding.<br>
<br>
BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE, from whatever cause, may generally be stopped by<br>
putting a plug of lint into the nostrils; if this does not do, apply a<br>
cold lotion to the forehead; raise the head, and place over it both<br>
arms, so that it will rest on the hands; dip the lint plug, slightly<br>
moistened, into some powdered gum arabic, and plug the nostrils again;<br>
or dip the plug into equal parts of powdered gum arabic and alum, and<br>
plug the nose. Or the plug may be dipped in Friar's balsam, or tincture<br>
of kino. Heat should be applied to the feet; and, in obstinate cases,<br>
the sudden shock of a cold key, or cold water poured down the spine,<br>
will often instantly stop the bleeding. If the bowels are confined, take<br>
a purgative. Injections of alum solution from a small syringe into the<br>
nose will often stop hemorrhage.<br>
<br>
VIOLENT SHOCKS will sometimes stun a person, and he will remain<br>
unconscious. Untie strings, collars, etc.; loosen anything that is tight<br>
and interferes with the breathing; raise the head; see if there is<br>
bleeding from any part; apply smelling-salts to the nose, and hot<br>
bottles to the feet.<br>
<br>
IN CONCUSSION, the surface of the body is cold and pale, and the pulse<br>
weak and small, the breathing slow and gentle, and the pupil of the eye<br>
generally contracted or small. You can get an answer by speaking loud,<br>
so as to arouse the patient. Give a little brandy and water, keep the<br>
place quiet, apply warmth, and do not raise the head too high. If you<br>
tickle the feet, the patient feels it.<br>
<br>
IN COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN from any cause, such as apoplexy, or a piece<br>
of fractured bone pressing on it, there is loss of sensation. If you<br>
tickle the feet of the injured person he does not feel it. You cannot<br>
arouse him so as to get an answer. The pulse is slow and labored; the<br>
breathing deep, labored, and snorting; the pupil enlarged. Raise the<br>
head, loosen strings or tight things, and send for a surgeon. If one<br>
cannot be got at once, apply mustard poultices to the feet and thighs,<br>
leeches to the temples, and hot water to the feet.<br>
<br>
CHOKING--When a person has a fish bone in the throat, insert the<br>
forefinger, press upon the root of the tongue, so as to induce vomiting;<br>
if this does not do, let him swallow a large piece of potato or soft<br>
bread; and if these fail, give a mustard emetic,<br>
<br>
FAINTING, HYSTERICS, ETC.--Loosen the garments, bathe the temples with<br>
water or eau-de-Cologne; open the window, admit plenty of fresh air,<br>
dash cold water on the face, apply hot bricks to the feet, and avoid<br>
bustle and excessive sympathy.<br>
<br>
DROWNING.--Attend to the following essential rules: 1. Lose no time. 2.<br>
Handle the body gently. 3. Carry the body face downward, with the head<br>
gently raised, and never hold it up by the feet. 4. Send for medical<br>
assistance immediately, and in the meantime act as follows: 5. Strip the<br>
body; rub it dry, then wrap it in hot blankets, and place it in a warm<br>
bed in a warm room. 6. Cleanse away the froth and mucus from the nose<br>
and month. 7. Apply warm bricks, bottles, bags of sand, etc. to the<br>
armpits, between the thighs, and to the soles of the feet. 8. Rub the<br>
surface of the body with the hands inclosed in warm, dry worsted socks.<br>
9. If possible, put the body into a warm bath. 10. To restore breathing,<br>
put the pipe of a common bellows into one nostril, carefully closing the<br>
other, and the mouth; at the same time drawing downward, and pushing<br>
gently backward, the upper part of the windpipe to allow a more free<br>
admission of air; blow the bellows gently, in order to inflate the<br>
lungs, till the breast be raised a little; then set the month and<br>
nostrils free, and press gently on the chest; repeat this until signs of<br>
life appear. The body should be covered the moment it is placed on the<br>
table, except the face, and all the rubbing carried on under the sheet<br>
or blanket. When they can be obtained, a number of tiles or bricks<br>
should be made tolerably hot in the fire, laid in a row on the table,<br>
covered with a blanket, and the body placed in such a manner on them<br>
that their heat may enter the spine. When the patient revives, apply<br>
smelling-salts to the nose, give warm wine or brandy and water.<br>
Cautions.--1. Never rub the body with salt or spirits. 2. Never roll the<br>
body on casks. 3. Continue the remedies for twelve hours without<br>
ceasing.<br>
<br>
HANGING--Loosen the cord, or whatever it may be by which the person has<br>
been suspended. Open the temporal artery or jugular vein, or bleed from<br>
the arm; employ electricity, if at hand, and proceed as for drowning.<br>
<br>
APPARENT DEATH FROM DRUNKENNESS--Raise the head; loosen the clothes,<br>
maintain warmth of surface, and give a mustard emetic as soon as the<br>
person can swallow.<br>
<br>
APOPLEXY AND FITS GENERALLY--Raise the head; loosen all tight clothes,<br>
strings, etc.; apply cold lotions to the head, and send for a surgeon.<br>
<br>
SUFFOCATION FROM NOXIOUS GASES, ETC.--Remove to the fresh air; dash cold<br>
vinegar and water in the face, neck, and breast; keep up the warmth of<br>
the body; if necessary, apply mustard poultices to the soles of the feet<br>
and to the spine, and try artificial respirations as in drowning, with<br>
electricity.<br>
<br>
LIGHTNING AND SUNSTROKE--Treat the same as apoplexy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">General Rules</span><br>
<br>
Always send immediately for a medical man. Save all fluids vomited, and<br>
articles of food, cups, glasses, etc., used by the patient before taken<br>
ill, and lock them up.<br>
<br>
As a rule give emetics after poisons that cause sleepiness and raving;<br>
chalk, milk, eggs, butter, and warm water, or oil, after poisons that<br>
cause vomiting and pain in the stomach and bowels, with purging; and<br>
when there is no inflammation about the throat, tickle it with a feather<br>
to excite vomiting.<br>
<br>
Vomiting may be caused by giving warm water, with a teaspoonful of<br>
mustard to the tumblerful, well stirred up. Sulphate of zinc (white<br>
vitriol) may be used in place of the mustard, or powdered alum. Powder<br>
of ipecacuanha, a teaspoonful rubbed up with molasses, may be employed<br>
for children. Tartar emetic should never be given, as it is excessively<br>
depressing, and uncontrollable in its effects. The stomach pump can only<br>
be used by skillful hands, and even then with caution.<br>
<br>
Opium and other Narcotics--After vomiting has occurred, cold water<br>
should be dashed over the face and head. The patient must be kept awake,<br>
walked about between two strong persons, made to grasp the handles of a<br>
galvanic battery, dosed with strong coffee, and vigorously slapped.<br>
Belladonna is an antidote for opium and for morphia, etc.; its active<br>
principles; and, on the other hand, the latter counteract the effects of<br>
belladonna. But a knowledge of medicine is necessary for dealing with<br>
these articles.<br>
<br>
Strychnia--After emetics have been freely and successfully given, the<br>
patient should be allowed to breathe the vapor of sulphuric ether,<br>
poured on a handkerchief and held to the face, in such quantities as to<br>
keep down the tendency to convulsions. Bromide of potassium, twenty<br>
grains at a dose, dissolved in syrup, may be given every hour.<br>
<br>
Alcoholic Poisoning should be combated by emetics, of which the sulphate<br>
of zinc, given as above directed, is the best. After that, strong coffee<br>
internally, and stimulation by heat externally, should be used.<br>
<br>
Acids are sometimes swallowed by mistake. Alkalies, lime water,<br>
magnesia, or common chalk mixed with water, may be freely given, and<br>
afterward mucilaginous drinks, such as thick gum water or flaxseed tea.<br>
<br>
Alkalies are less frequently taken in injurious strength or quantity,<br>
but sometimes children swallow lye by mistake. Common vinegar may be<br>
given freely, and then castor or sweet oil in full doses--a<br>
tablespoonful at a time, repeated every half hour or two.<br>
<br>
Nitrate of silver when swallowed is neutralized by common table salt<br>
freely given in solution in water.<br>
<br>
The salts of mercury or arsenic (often kept as bedbug poison), which are<br>
powerful irritants, are apt to be very quickly fatal. Milk or the whites<br>
of eggs may be freely given and afterward a very thin paste of flour and<br>
water. In these cases an emetic is to be given after the poison is<br>
neutralized.<br>
<br>
Phosphorus paste, kept for roach poison or in parlor matches, is<br>
sometimes eaten by children and has been willfully taken for the purpose<br>
of suicide. It is a powerful irritant. The first thing to be done is to<br>
give freely of magnesia and water; then to give mucilaginous drinks as<br>
flaxseed tea, gum water or sassafras pith and water; and lastly to<br>
administer finely powdered bone-charcoal, either in pill or in mixture<br>
with water.<br>
<br>
In no case of poisoning should there be any avoidable delay in obtaining<br>
the advice of a physician, and, meanwhile, the friends or bystanders<br>
should endeavor to find out exactly what has been taken, so that the<br>
treatment adopted may be as prompt and effective as possible.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">KEEP STILL.</span><br>
<br>
Keep still. When trouble is brewing, keep still. Even when slander is<br>
getting on its legs, keep still. When your feelings are hurt, keep<br>
still, till you recover from your excitement at any rate. Things look<br>
differently through an unagitated eye. A doctor relates how once in a<br>
commotion he wrote a letter, and sent it, and wished he had not. "I had<br>
another commotion and wrote a long letter; but life had rubbed a little<br>
sense into me. I kept that letter in my pocket against the day when I<br>
could look it over without agitation and without tears. I was glad I<br>
did. Less and less it seemed necessary to send it I was not sure it<br>
would do any hurt, but in my doubt I leaned to reticence, and eventually<br>
it was destroyed."<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PHILOSOPHICAL FACTS.</span><br>
<br>
The greatest height at which visible clouds ever exist does not exceed<br>
ten miles.<br>
<br>
Air is about eight hundred and fifteen times lighter than water.<br>
<br>
The pressure of the atmosphere upon every square foot of the earth<br>
amounts to two thousand one hundred and sixty pounds.<br>
<br>
The violence of the expansion of water when freezing is sufficient to<br>
cleave a globe of copper of such thickness as to require a force of<br>
27,000 pounds, to produce the same effect.<br>
<br>
During the conversion of ice into water one hundred and forty degrees of<br>
heat are absorbed.<br>
<br>
Water, when converted into steam, increases in bulk eighteen hundred<br>
times.<br>
<br>
In one second of time--in one beat of the pendulum of a clock--light<br>
travels two hundred thousand miles. Were a cannon ball shot toward the<br>
sun, and were it to maintain full speed, it would be twenty years in<br>
reaching it, and yet light travels through this space in seven or eight<br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
Strange as it may appear, a ball of a ton weight, and another of the<br>
same material of an ounce weight, falling from any height will reach the<br>
ground at the same time.<br>
<br>
The heat does not increase as we rise above the earth nearer to the sun,<br>
but decreases rapidly until, beyond the regions of the atmosphere, in<br>
void, it is estimated that the cold is about seventy degrees below zero.<br>
The line of perpetual frost at the equator is 15,000 feet altitude;<br>
13,000 feet between the tropics; and 9,000 to 4,000 between the<br>
latitudes of forty degrees and forty-nine degrees.<br>
<br>
At a depth of forty-five feet under ground, the temperature of the earth<br>
is uniform throughout the year.<br>
<br>
The human ear is so extremely sensitive that it can hear a sound that<br>
lasts only the twenty-four thousandth part of a second.<br>
<br>
Sound travels at the rate of one thousand one hundred and forty-two feet<br>
per second-about thirteen miles in a minute. So that if we hear a clap<br>
of thunder half a minute after the flash, we may calculate that the<br>
discharge of electricity is six and a half miles off.<br>

ARE YOU TOO FAT?<br>
<br>
DOWNS' Obesity Reducer<br>
<br>
Will Reduce your Fat<br>
<br>
Downs' Obesity Reducer is unlike other reducing remedies in that it does<br>
not require other medicines to strengthen up the system after it has<br>
performed its function of relieving the patient of superfluous fat. On<br>
the contrary Downs' Obesity Reducer not only does away with obesity, but<br>
it strengthens the entire system, discharges all impurities and tones up<br>
the blood.<br>
<br>
It is easy to take; being put up in pill and capsule form.<br>
<br>
Downs' Obesity Reducer contains no injurious drugs; a child might take<br>
it in any quantity without harmful effects. It is not one of the<br>
so-called "new discoveries." It has been used successfully for over<br>
thirty years and has never produced an evil effect. Scores of people<br>
have been reduced by it from 20 to 80 pounds and never felt better than<br>
while taking and after taking.<br>

As a cleanser it is superior to soap. It penetrates the skin and removes<br>
the secretions which if allowed to remain will cause blackheads and<br>
pimples.<br>
<br>
Wonder Face Cream contains no grease and will not grow hair. It will<br>
remove tan and sunburn, give the user a fresh complexion, whiten the<br>
skin, will gradually remove freckles and when used with massage will<br>
remove wrinkles. One jar will convince you. If you do not think this<br>
possible give it a trial.<br>
<br>
Every person going out in the sun or wind, especially on automobile<br>
rides, requires a face dressing, and only a non-grease cream can be<br>
used. Wonder Face Cream is perfect for this purpose. An invisible<br>
dressing of Wonder Cream will protect the face, preventing sunburn,<br>
roughening of the skin, etc, No one will suffer from sunburn if they<br>
will put on a dressing of Wonder Face Cream before going out.<br>

WOMAN'S BEAUTY IS HER POWER<br>
<br>
Every woman can be beautiful if she uses Geo. W. Laird's "Bloom of<br>
Youth"<br>
<br>
WOMAN'S BEAUTY RULES THE WORLD<br>
<br>
Kings, Emperors, Sultans, Millionaires, Statesmen and men of influence<br>
all bow to women's beauty. Then it is not to be wondered at that women<br>
do all in their power to attain that wonderful charm. A clear, smooth,<br>
soft, white, beautiful skin is far more attractive than the most costly<br>
costume. LAIRD'S "BLOOM OF YOUTH" will remove all imperfections of the<br>
skin--tan, freckles and all other discolorations--leaving it clear and<br>
beautiful. Laird's "Bloom of Youth" has been in use the past fifty years<br>
and improved from time to time, until now it is simply a perfect toilet<br>
preparation.<br>
<br>
WOMAN'S DUTY<br>
<br>
Woman should use every legitimate means in her power to make herself<br>
attractive if nature has not been generous to her and blessed her with a<br>
clear, soft, beautiful skin. She should use some of the artificial means<br>
of attaining the desired effect. We would recommend the use of LAIRD'S<br>
"BLOOM OF YOUTH." It has been in use the past fifty years by millions of<br>
society ladies, actresses and opera singers both in this country and in<br>
Europe.<br>

Physiological Tonicum<br>
<br>
This is what may be described as a scientific iron tonic. In it the<br>
Ferric and Ferrous Oxides are combined in exactly the same proportions<br>
as they are found combined in the normal human blood; hence it is that<br>
the Physiological Tonicum is a blood maker, or, if the term be<br>
preferred, blood purifier--it corrects the blood. Thus it is that this<br>
tonic (which may be used in connection with other medicine) is useful in<br>
nearly all diseases, save such as are characterized by plethoric states,<br>
or full-bloodedness.<br>
<br>
In any instance where the physician wants to prescribe iron which will<br>
cause no untoward effects, such as disturbing the stomach, affecting the<br>
teeth, etc., this PHYSIOLOGICAL TONICUM is the best preparation of iron<br>
he can find in the market.<br>

ABILENA<br>
America's Truest and Purest Natural Laxative.<br>
One of the most remarkable of all natural phenomena is the<br>
FAMOUS WELLS OF ABILENA<br>
from which flows a perfect laxative water.<br>
<br>
Scientists of today, with the accumulated knowledge of 1,000 years to<br>
guide them, have not been able to manufacture a harmless, non-irritating<br>
laxative which relieves constipation and stimulates the liver as AbilenA<br>
Water does.<br>
<br>
You will never need laxative medicines of any kind--pills, tablets,<br>
capsules, salts, artificial waters--if you occasionally drink a<br>
wine-glass of AbilenA when conditions call for a laxative or cathartic.<br>
<br>
AbilenA comes to you pure--just as it flows from the Famous Wells of<br>
AbilenA--harmless as the water you drink--clear, sparkling, vitalizing.<br>
It flushes and cleanses the system thoroughly, and in the gentlest way<br>
possible. Instead of irritating the delicate membranes of the stomach<br>
and bowels, as drugs and artificial waters are very apt to do, it<br>
relieves congestions and soothes these membranes, and it stimulates<br>
liver activities.<br>
<br>
There is no magic in the name, AbilenA, nor no special virtue simply<br>
because it happens to be America's only natural cathartic water, but its<br>
splendid clinical value and effect is due solely to the fact that<br>
AbilenA is almost wholly pure and true Sodium Sulphate--the world's<br>
truest representative of this ideal laxative and reconstructive base,<br>
All the other waters on the markets are largely solutions of Epsom<br>
salts, consequently are nauseous, harsh and irritating. The same thing<br>
is more or less true with pills, powders and the manufactured<br>
cathartics.<br>
<br>
AbilenA is a safe, sure, inexpensive laxative and cathartic, convenient<br>
and pleasant to take, suited for old and young alike, a cure for<br>
constipation and biliousness, and truly the ideal family remedy.<br>
<br>
AbilenA is America's Only Bottled Natural Cathartic Water.<br>
<br>
We will mail, free, upon application, "The Natural Method," an<br>
interesting booklet on the importance of normal elimination and a study<br>
of the comparative values of the better known cathartics.<br>

THE SAD STORY OF MY FATHER'S GREAT SUFFERING FROM CANCER<br>
<br>
Read the following and be convinced. There's hope for you.<br>
<br>
Forty-five years ago my father, who was himself a doctor, had a vicious<br>
cancer that was eating away his life. The best physicians in America<br>
could do nothing for him. After nine long years of awful suffering, and<br>
after the cancer had totally eaten away his nose and portions of his<br>
face (as shown in his picture here given) his palate was entirely<br>
destroyed together with portions of his throat. Father fortunately<br>
discovered the great remedy that cured him. He lived over 40 years and<br>
no return of the disease.<br>
<br>
The same discovery has now thousands who were threatened with operation<br>
and death. And to prove that this is the truth we will give their sworn<br>
statement if you will write us. Doctors, Lawyers, Mechanics, Ministers,<br>
Laboring Men, Bankers and all classes recommend this glorious<br>
life-saving discovery, and we want the whole world to benefit by it.<br>
<br>
HAVE YOU CANCER, Tumors, Ulcers, Abscesses, Fever Sores, Goitre,
Catarrh,<br>
Salt-Rheum, Rheumatism, Piles, Eczema, Scald Head, or Scrofula in any
form?<br>
<br>
Ask your Druggist for MIXER'S CANCER &amp; SCROFULA SYRUP.<br>
<br>
It will cost you nothing to learn the truth about this wonderful home<br>
treatment without the knife or caustic. And if you know anyone who is<br>
afflicted with any disease above mentioned, you can do them a Christian<br>
act of kindness by telling them of our great treatment and how to get<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Forty years' experience guarantees success. Ask your Druggist for<br>
illustrated Booklet FREE, showing half tones of many people cured, with<br>
their testimonials.<br>

"Look Out for the Pennies, and the Dollars Will Take Care of Themselves"<br>

--An Old Saying<br>
<br>
Look Out For the Blood Cells and the Body Will Take Care of Itself<br>
<br>
You can't expect to be well, or to ever accomplish much in the world if<br>
the blood and nerve cells are lacking strength and vitality. As the<br>
blood races through your body--head and brain, every little cell should<br>
be brim full of life and power. Then you feel the vim and "go" that will<br>
make you a power among your fellow men. No nervousness, no indecision,<br>
no signs of the weakling if you use Dr. Hoag's<br>
<br>
CELL TISSUE TONIC<br>
<br>
The great nerve and tissue builder. This goes straight to the cells of<br>
the blood and enriches them and puts new strength into them so they can<br>
combat and throw off disease.<br>
<br>
This is undoubtedly the greatest and grandest REBUILDER AND STRENGTHENER<br>
that modern medicine has produced.<br>
<br>
Cell Tissue Tonic is particularly recommended for Paleness and Weakness,<br>
Debilitation, Stomach and Bowel Trouble (of both infants and adults),<br>
Hysteria, Fainting Spells, Insomnia (sleeplessness) and Poor<br>
Assimilation of Food.<br>

<br>
A real Hair Restorative? Yes--that's just it--a real one at last--one<br>
that invigorates the roots and promotes the restoration of the hair to<br>
its original beauty, luxuriance and color.<br>
<br>
Better than any argument is the Restorative itself--for you to try. We<br>
are only too glad to throw ourselves wholly on the merits of Golden Rule<br>
Hair Restorative, so we years ago set aside thousands of dollars to<br>
spend on big free Sample bottles.<br>
<br>
If we didn't know what our preparation would do this would be reckless<br>
extravagance. But we do know and believe that the quickest way to help<br>
you to find it out is to place a bottle of it in your bands.<br>
<br>
We know the annoyance of having one's hair fall and turn gray, perhaps<br>
while you are still young. It is the result perhaps of some unusual<br>
worry or care, but that does not prevent friends and neighbors from the<br>
knowing nod that says, "Growing old."<br>
<br>
Not so, it is only a run down condition of the roots of the hair--just<br>
as the body gets run down. But you should not permit this. It is not<br>
necessary and this needless look of age impairs your usefulness and<br>
popularity in society and business.<br>
<br>
Golden Rule Hair Restorative simply invigorates the roots--waking them<br>
up--toning them up--rejuvenating them until they are rendered lively and<br>
vigorous as in youth, The obvious result is that the growth of the hair<br>
is promoted. Hair can starve and wither like any plant that gets its<br>
life from its roots. If the roots are vigorous and healthy, the hair is<br>
bound to be natural.<br>
<br>
We want you to accept a large sample bottle with our compliments.<br>
<br>
We want you to know what a remarkable remedy this is. If you don't need<br>
it yourself, get it for some friend. The truth is, however, that<br>
everyone should use Golden Rule Hair Restorative as a dressing for the<br>
Hair to keep it healthy, just as you use a dentrifice to keep the teeth<br>
dainty and healthy.<br>
<br>
Get this bottle and try it. Remember its continued use tends to stop<br>
hair from falling by promoting a vigorous growth of healthy hair.<br>
Remember that it restores color to the hair. It is harmless and a trial<br>
will convince you that it is just what we claim for it. Send to us<br>
today, enclosing 10c to pay postage and packing, and the bottle will<br>
come by first mail--in a plain wrapper with full explanations.<br>

Have You Piles?<br>
Why Suffer Longer When ROSSMAN'S PILE CURE&nbsp; IS AT HAND<br>
<br>
44-1/2 South St., Glens Falls, N. Y., June 3, 1909.<br>
G. A. McKinstry, Hudson, N. Y.<br>
Dear Sir:--By the advice of my druggist, Mr. Bert H. Bentley. I bought<br>
and used your Pile Cure and have found it a wonder. I have been around<br>
the world and have used all kinds of salves, but never found anything<br>
equal to yours.<br>
<br>
In the year 1900 I enlisted in the U. S. Regulars and went to the<br>
Philippines. Was operated upon for hemorrhoids and was all right for<br>
three months. When itching developed, went to the hospital, where I was<br>
told I had itching piles.<br>
<br>
I have been doctoring for nine years for same and found no relief until<br>
I used a box of Rossman's Cure. I think it wonderful.<br>
<br>
Wishing you further success, I remain,<br>
Yours very truly,<br>
WM. F. CARTER.<br>

A GOOD TOILET WATER<br>
<br>
But note what that adjective means--"Good." The good things of this life<br>
are none too many in number, and unfortunately we are forced in nearly<br>
every instance to prove at our own expense the superiority or<br>
inferiority of each article, or commodity--whether it be an investment,<br>
a friend or a household necessity.<br>
<br>
A true toilet water is not a luxury--it is an absolute necessity to<br>
those who appreciate the highest form of health and appearance.<br>
<br>
A true toilet water invigorates and adds to the general health of the<br>
skin tissues.<br>
<br>
A true toilet water relieves skin irritations--unreliable imitations<br>
aggravate them. It is the imitation that is the most costly sort of<br>
luxury.<br>
<br>
The Toilet Water de luxe is Baldwin's Vivian Violet. It is made of only<br>
the best material, and in its composition--it is the triumph of the art<br>
of distillation,<br>
<br>
The odor of Vivian Violet Toilet Water is delicate though lasting and<br>
delightful to the most refined taste.<br>
<br>
Baldwin's products have a reputation of 40 years behind them. When<br>
buying your Face Powder, Perfumes and Toilet Water insist on Baldwin's.<br>

<br>
Takes all the odor out of perspiration without injurying the skin or the<br>

Is highly recommended by physicians as the best antiseptic and deodorant<br>
powder for destroying offensive odors of the body.<br>
<br>
Its wonderful soothing qualities makes it indispensable in the home.<br>
Relieves chafing, scalding, sunburn, windburn and nothing can equal it<br>
after shaving. For bad smelly feet it has no rival.<br>

DROSIS DESTROYS ALL ODORS<br>
from excessive perspiration, not by overpowering with another odor, but<br>
by its own process of elimination, effects an entire absence of any odor<br>
whatsoever,<br>

DROSIS IS NOT ABSORBED BY THE PORES<br>
and is a necessity, positively indispensable on the toilet table of<br>
every lady.<br>

TO BREAK UP A COLD IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS!<br>
<br>
Cure Any Cough That is Curable<br>
<br>
Get from the drugstore, and mix together in a large bottle, 2 ounces of<br>
glycerine, 8 ounces of pure whisky and 1/2 ounce of virgin oil of pine.<br>
Shake well and take a teaspoonful every four hours. It will quickly heal<br>
any irritation of the mucous surface in throat and bronchial organs.<br>
<br>
This formula was used and recommended for many years by the late Dr. W.<br>
A. Leach, who claimed it would break up a cold in twenty-four hours and<br>
cure any curable cough. The well-known healing properties of pine, in<br>
its action on the respiratory organs, are present in the genuine virgin<br>
oil of pine. This, combined with its absolute freedom from opiates and<br>
narcotic drugs of any description, makes it an invaluable remedy for the<br>
family medicine chest.<br>
<br>
In the case of young children, a drop of the pine on a little sugar<br>
provides a pleasant, as well as effective remedy for coughs and colds.<br>
Oil of pine is also frequently used in this way by preachers and public<br>
speakers, to relieve hoarseness and other affections of the vocal<br>
organs. Its effect is almost instantaneous. The genuine virgin oil of<br>
pine is put up in half-ounce vials for dispensing through druggists and<br>
prepared only in the laboratories of the Leach Chemical Co., Cincinnati,<br>
O., who guarantee its freshness and purity.<br>

Bryans' Great Asthma Remedy<br>
<br>
A faithful trial will convince anyone of the true merit and worth of<br>
Bryans' Asthma Remedy, Professor P. J. De Lara, of Detroit, Mich., says:<br>
<br>
"I cannot speak too highly of Bryans' Asthma Remedy; which has been so<br>
beneficial to me. For over thirty years I have suffered with Asthma and<br>
have spent thousands of dollars for medicines from the best specialists<br>
in Europe and America without any relief, and up to three months ago I<br>
lost hope in any kind of treatment; some reputable doctors told me I<br>
never could be cured. I then heard of Bryans' Asthma Remedy and took on<br>
myself to try it. The result astonished me. After using nine or ten<br>
boxes the disease abated and by degrees left me, and I am glad to say<br>
that I have no more of those severe spasmodic attacks and consider<br>
myself permanently cured."<br>

WONDERFUL MISSION of THE INTERNAL BATH<br>
<br>
By means of THE "J. B. L. CASCADE"<br>
<br>
Have you read of the wonderful cures made by the Internal Bath? Do you<br>
know that it goes to the root of all disease and eradicates the cause?<br>
Do you know that many of the greatest physicians in the world endorse<br>
and prescribe this treatment, and also that among its patrons are some<br>
of the most distinguished people in all parts of the world, as well as<br>
hosts of others from whom we have grateful letters, which we should be<br>
pleased to furnish to those interested upon application?<br>
<br>
Do you know that an occasional Internal Bath is a better preventive of<br>
illness and preserver of health than any other single means? Do you know<br>
that it makes beautiful complexions? Do you know it cures constipation<br>
and prevents and cures appendicitis? The record of its benefits reads<br>
like a revelation to those hitherto unacquainted with it.<br>
<br>
It is used by means of the "J.B.L. Cascade"--the only scientific<br>
appliance for this purpose--by hundreds of the best known people in all<br>
parts of the world, by innumerable ministers, lawyers, and those persons<br>
whose intelligence gives unequivocal weight to their testimony.<br>
<br>
It is known that seven-tenths of all disease arises from the retention<br>
of foreign matter in the human system, also that the greater part of<br>
this waste is held in the colon, which is nature's sewer, hence the<br>
flushing of this sewer removes the greatest cause of disease. While<br>
immeasurably the best treatment for constipation, indigestion, etc.,<br>
there is scarcely any known disease for which the "J.B.L. Cascade" may<br>
not be confidently prescribed.<br>
<br>
This hygienic, drugless treatment saves hundreds of dollars yearly in<br>
doctors' and druggists' bills. We want to send to every reader of this<br>
publication, sick or well, a simple statement setting forth this<br>
treatment. It contains matter which must interest every thinking person.<br>
Write for our pamphlet. "The What, The Why, The Way," which will we sent<br>
free on application.<br>

The Two Creams Every Woman Needs<br>
PLEXO<br>
<br>
Greaseless Cream<br>
A superb toilet cream of delicate fragrance made from the purest<br>
ingredients. Imparts the velvety softness so much desired by the<br>
well-groomed woman of today. Indispensable to motorists, golfers and<br>
bathers. Protects against the sun and wind. Apply before going outdoors<br>
and massage until it vanishes.<br>
<br>
Cleansing Cream<br>
will positively remove all impurities. Will impart a fresh complexion to<br>
all women striving to retain a fair skin. Plexo Cleansing Cream is<br>
absolutely pure and wholesome having no irritating qualities. Exposure<br>
usually plays havoc with a delicate complexion, but the application of<br>
Plexo Cleansing Cream will keep a most sensitive skin in excellent<br>
condition.<br>
<br>
Try these two creams. They are exactly what you need for keeping your<br>
skin smooth, soft and clear.<br>

DAISY FLY KILLER<br>
<br>
THE Daisy Fly Killer is a tightly sealed ornamental metal box provided<br>
with five holes, into which are secured felt wicks, and contains a fly<br>
killing material. When filled with water and the cork replaced, and is<br>
thoroughly shaken (keeping it level), the fly-killing material inside<br>
mixes with the water and is absorbed through the wicks, which become<br>
moist and sweet from the inside contents, the flies being attracted by<br>
the moisture and sweetness in the wicks, get a taste of it and will soon<br>
die, The fly-killing material inside is sufficient to last through the<br>
season, for when the water evaporates there is enough of the fly-killing<br>
material inside to stand many fillings with water and prove effectual as<br>
a fly-killer. After several fillings, it is better to sweeten the water<br>
with a teaspoonful of sugar before putting it in the Daisy.<br>
<br>
Daisy Fly Killer placed anywhere attracts and kills all flies. Neat,<br>
clean, ornamental, convenient, cheap. Lasts all season. Made of metal,<br>
cannot spill or tip over, will not spoil or injure anything.<br>

ALETA HAIR TONIC<br>
For the Cure of<br>
DANDRUFF<br>
<br>
Many who have tried for five and ten years, and have spent hundreds of<br>
dollars for a cure without effect, have had the most pleasing results in<br>
a short time from the use of ALETA. Hard crusts and scales, as well as<br>
the most simple cases of dandruff, yield to the applications of this<br>
remedy. Itching scalps and eczematic troubles are effectually treated.<br>
One of our most prominent physicians made this remark: "IT IS THE FIRST<br>
TIME FOR ME TO HAVE ANY SATISFACTION FROM A DANDRUFF CURE."<br>
<br>
ALETA is applied but once a week. It is as clean as water upon the head;<br>
it contains no oils or other substance to gum the hair or to make it<br>
sticky. IT DOES THE WORK.<br>
<br>
Hair grows faster and looks better when the scalp is clean and healthy,<br>
and there is no remedy which brings these good conditions so readily and<br>
perfectly, as the ALETA<br>

HAS THE ENDORSEMENT OF All WHO HAVE USED IT FOR<br>
Coughs and Colds<br>

A trifling, seemingly insignificant cough, if neglected, works down the<br>
throat to the bronchial tubes and finally to the lungs, and unless<br>
checked, may result seriously. At the first sign of a cough take Allen's<br>
Cough Balsam.<br>
<br>
Bronchitis<br>
Barking, backing, rasping, and irritating the throat are the constant<br>
accompaniments of this disease. Don't delay a minute when you have this<br>
ailment. A few doses of Allen's Cough Balsam will usually bring relief<br>
and frequently break it up.<br>
<br>
Sore Throat, Quinsy, Tonsilitis<br>
These troubles are confined to the throat and breathing tubes, and<br>
should be cured at once, or more serious ailments develop, Allen's Cough<br>
Balsam is prepared for just such cases and has been used for over 50<br>
years.<br>
<br>
Its good effects can be noticed at once.<br>

Anyone Can Enjoy This Delightful Turkish Bath At Home--Cost 2 cents<br>
<br>
Surface Bathing Is Insufficient---The Turkish Bath Is The Only Effective<br>
Method Of Purifying The Pores---The "Robinson" Makes All Simple,<br>
Delightful and Economical.<br>
<br>
Here's the rejuvenation cabinet for every home. Here's the producer and

preserver of clear, clean skin, good spirits, great physical exuberance
<br>
that puts a sharper edge on the enjoyment of living. The "Robinson" <br>
Thermal Bath Cabinet is wonderfully simple. A bath in it costs only 2 <br>
cents and takes only 15 minutes. How much better this is than having to
<br>
go to some hotel or public Turkish Baths and pay out a lot of money for
<br>
something not a whit better and not one-tenth as convenient. Have it in
<br>

Helen Marlowe's "Blush of Roses"<br>
<br>
Helen Marlowe's "Blush of Roses" is a scientifically prepared liquid<br>
rouge so perfectly natural in effect, that its use defies detection on<br>
the closest scrutiny. It is easily applied; a delicate tint is obtained<br>
by one light application; a deeper tint by more than one. Unlike the<br>
majority of rouges now before the public it does not give that blotched<br>
appearance to the face.<br>
<br>
"Blush of Roses" is an absolutely water-proof rouge. Surf bathing will<br>
not remove it. It remains a soft beautiful pink until it is washed off<br>
with pure soap and water. "Blush of Roses" is not removed by<br>
perspiration. "Blush of Roses" is guaranteed to be perfectly harmless.<br>
<br>
"Blush of Roses" is used and highly recommended by the most refined<br>
ladies in private and public life. Price 50 cents. Prepared only by<br>

DR. MARTELS FEMALE PILLS<br>
18 YEARS THE STANDARD<br>
<br>
A scientifically Prepared Remedy (For Disturbances of the Menstrual<br>
Functions) Sold Only Through the Medical and Drug Profession; for<br>
Medical Purposes Only.<br>
<br>
A FEW REMARKS OF IMPORTANCE TO WOMANKIND<br>
<br>
Dr. Martel's Female Pills is a preparation of unequaled excellence,<br>
which acts as a positive tonic on the female reproductive organs, and<br>
imparts to them the proper functional action nature demands in normal,<br>
healthy women, without untoward action. Dr. Martel's Female Pills<br>
possess only virtues of the highest possible value. It re-establishes<br>
the proper action of the generative organs by restoring their vitality,<br>
and not by merely stimulating them excessively (and temporarily), as do<br>
so many other agents of this class.<br>
<br>
In the treatment of all disturbances of the menstrual functions arising<br>
from debility, anemia or nervousness, Dr. Martel's Female Pills are of<br>
unsurpassed value. This preparation is a uterine and ovarian sedative,<br>
and is of special service in treating congestive and inflammatory<br>
conditions of these organs which are accompanied with unusual pain.<br>
<br>
Amenorrhea.--When the menstrual flow is scanty or suppressed, as a<br>
result of sudden exposure to cold, worry, fright, grief or other violent<br>
mental shocks.<br>
<br>
Menorrhagia.--Profuse menstruation is at once relieved by Dr. Martel's<br>
Pills. The preparation instantly restores vigor to the uterus which has<br>
been lost through the excessive flow of blood. It is advisable to begin<br>
the use of the preparation a few days in advance of the flow in those<br>
cases which are disposed to menstruate profusely at each visitation.<br>
<br>
Menopause.--The nervous and mental disturbances which frequently precede<br>
and succeed the final cessation of ovulation and menstruation respond<br>
readily to the anti-spasmodic and tranquilizing action of Dr. Martel's<br>
Pills. Where hysteria, melancholia, moroseness and despondency are<br>
conspicuous factors, the preparation can be used to great advantage. The<br>
improvement in the mental state of the patient after the administration<br>
of this product is always durable and pronounced.<br>
<br>
Dysmenorrhea.--In the treatment of congestive, neuralgic, mechanical or<br>
membranous types of dysmenorrhea, the action of Dr. Martel's Pills is<br>
particularly gratifying.<br>
<br>
THIS PREPARATION IS OF PARTICULAR VALUE IN THE TREATMENT OF MENSTRUAL<br>
IRREGULARITIES FROM ANY CAUSE, AS ABOVE STATED, WHICH FAIL TO RESPOND TO<br>
OTHER AND ORDINARY MEDICAL REMEDIES.<br>
<br>
It is a well known, and scientifically proven fact, that all women are<br>
not constitutionally or temperamentally alike. Where some respond<br>
readily to one mode of treatment others do not. For this reason we have<br>
prepared a preparation designed for such instances. This remedy is Dr.<br>
Martel's Special Female Pills. $5.00 Box.<br>

Nervous? Suffer From Indigestion, Irregular Kidneys, Bowel Trouble,<br>
Appendicitis, Gall Stones--Here Is Relief<br>
<br>
When your head aches; when your breath is bad; when your bowels or<br>
kidneys are irregular; when your appetite fails or the twinges of<br>
indigestion make you regret each meal; when your nervous system has gone<br>
to pieces--then is your stomach sending its wireless message for help.<br>
<br>
The trouble may be in the stomach itself--indigestion--dyspepsia, and<br>
their nightmare evils.<br>
<br>
The intestinal tract may be deranged or the liver clogged, or it may be<br>
gall stones. Your case may not have reached the gall stone stage. It may<br>
be of a different nature--threatened appendicitis, for example. In any<br>
case, whether it be bad stomach, torpid liver or weakened and inflamed<br>
bowels--the answer to that wireless should be Fruitola and Traxo.<br>
<br>
These are two remarkable preparations used in combination, which for the<br>
past 20 years and more have released thousands from the pangs of<br>
dyspepsia and have saved as many from operations for gall stones and<br>
appendicitis.<br>
<br>
Fruitola cleanses, lubricates and soothes all the channels of the<br>
digestive system, without the least pain, griping or resulting weakness.<br>
It is nutritive in effect. It revives the appetite, clears the way for<br>
perfect digestion and thorough assimilation, allows Nature to make pure<br>
blood, firm flesh, strong muscles, healthy tissue and store up vital<br>
energy. A whole bottle of Fruitola is to be taken at once; this to be<br>
followed by small doses of Traxo to complete the strengthening and<br>
toning effect on the stomach, to insure regular, natural action of<br>
bowels and kidneys and to give permanence to all the benefits of the<br>
treatment. The gentle action of Traxo on the kidneys removes waste and<br>
by keeping the liver active it frees the general circulation of bile--it<br>
clears the eye and complexion and brings the glow of health to the<br>
cheeks.<br>
<br>
Pinus, the great rheumatism remedy, has saved thousands of sufferers<br>
after long years of agonizing attacks. Joints swollen and misshapen by<br>
Inflammatory Rheumatism, nerves and muscles overpowered by the intense<br>
misery of Chronic Rheumatism and Sciatica have been restored to health<br>
and strength--pain and swelling banished by the marvelous properties of<br>
Pinus, a product of California's wonderful soil and sun.<br>
<br>
Fruitola, Traxo and Pinus are guaranteed under the Pure Food and Drugs<br>
Act. They are entirely vegetable and there is not a single ingredient<br>
that can harm the most sensitive system when taken as directed. They are<br>
made from the natural products of California, the land of health and<br>
sunshine.<br>

<br>
The Way To Do.<br>
<br>
There are just three ways of reducing fat: starvation, exercise and<br>
medical treatment. Anyone can reduce by starvation methods. Let him eat<br>
nothing for three weeks and the fat will drop from his bones, but the<br>
after effects are bad. Debilitated looking wrinkles. Use Gaveck Tablets,<br>
eat most anything.<br>
<br>
K-E-E-P Y-O-U-N-G<br>
by not taking on flesh. That makes one look old and flabby. Gaveck<br>
Tablets are harmless, a reducing tonic to the system. Give them a fair<br>
trial. Beware of imitations.<br>
